# *1.1* Function And Change
In mathematics, a *function* is used to represent the dependence of one quantity upon another.

###### Example
In 2015, Boston Massachusetts, had the highest annual snowfall, 110.6 inches, since recording started in 1872. The table shows one 14-day period in which the city broke another record with a total of 64.4 inches.

___Daily Snowfall in inches for Boston, January 27 to February 9, 2015___
|Day|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Snowfall|22.1|0.2|0|0.7|1.3|0|16.2|0|0|0.8|0|0.9|7.4|14.8|

The snowfall follows a function. Each day, $t$, has a unique snowfall, $S$, associated with it.

A __function__ is a rule that takes certain numbers as inputs and assigns to each a definite output number. The set of all input numbers is called the __domain__ of the function and the set of resulting output numbers is called the __range__ of the function.

#### Question 1
Give Domain and Range for the folded paper volume.[^1]

a) Domain: $0< x< 4$
b) Range: $0\leq V(x) \leq \frac{19- \sqrt{97}}{6}$
c) $h$ Height
d) $V$ Volume

#### Question 2
What is the rule of 4?

Table, Graph, Formula, Words

#### Question 3
What was the numerical approach of the folded paper?[^1]

A graph.

|$V(l)$|$l*l*w=Vin^3$|
|:-|-:|
|$V(0)$|$0*11*8=0in^3$|
|$V(1)$|$1*9*6=54in^3$|
|$V(2)$|$2*7*4=56in^3$|
|$V(3)$|$3*5*2=30in^3$|
|$V(4)$|$4*3*0=0in^3$|

#### Question 4
$V(x)=x(11-2x)(8-2x)$
$V(x)=4x^3-38x^2+88x$

#### Question 5
