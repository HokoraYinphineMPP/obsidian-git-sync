# *1.1* Function And Change
In mathematics, a *function* is used to represent the dependence of one quantity upon another.

###### Example
In 2015, Boston Massachusetts, had the highest annual snowfall, 110.6 inches, since recording started in 1872. The table shows one 14-day period in which the city broke another record with a total of 64.4 inches.

___Daily Snowfall in inches for Boston, January 27 to February 9, 2015___
|Day|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Snowfall|22.1|0.2|0|0.7|1.3|0|16.2|0|0|0.8|0|0.9|7.4|14.8|

The snowfall follows a function. Each day, $t$, has a unique snowfall, $S$, associated with it.
