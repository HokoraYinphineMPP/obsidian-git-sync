# Limits

## The idea of continuity
roughly speaking, a function is continuous on an interval if its graph has no breaks jumps or holes in that interval.
###### Example
- The function $f(x)=3x^3-x^2+2x-1$ is continous on any interval
- The function $f(x)=1/x$ is not defined at $x=0$. it is continous on any interval not contating 0
## The Numerical Viewpoint: Continuity at a Point
In practical word, continuity of a function at a point is important because it means that small errors in the independent variable lead to small errors in the value of the function. Conversely, if a function is not continous at a point, a small error in input measurement can lead to an enourmous error in output.
###### Example
- Supposed that $f(x)=x^2$ and that we want to compute $f(\pi)$. Knowing $f$ is continous tells up that taking $x=3.14$ should give a good approximation to $f(\pi)$, and that we can get as accurate an approximation to $f(\pi)$ as we want by using enough decimals of $\pi$.

- Investigate the continuity of $f(x)=x^2$ at $x=2$.
