## The idea of continuity
roughly speaking, a function is continuous on an interval if its graph has no breaks jumps or holes in that interval.
###### Example
the function $f(x)=3x^3-x^2+2x-1$ is continous on any interval
The function $f(x)=1/x$ is not defined at $x=0$. it is continous on any interval not contating 0
