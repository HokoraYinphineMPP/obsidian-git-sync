The CSUSB Writing Centers conduct one-to-one student writing conferences and facilitate workshops with faculty members in a variety of campus classrooms. Students come to work on writing projects for a wide variety of courses across the university. Our writing consultants are graduate and undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines.

Writing consultants work with writers at all stages of the composing process, helping to interpret assignments, discover topics, expand ideas, clarify organization, incorporate counter-arguments, cite references, edit, and proofread. Several consultants work specifically with multilingual writers to help them negotiate linguistic and cultural differences in written composition; these consultants also conduct informal English conversation groups for multilingual speakers. Writing Center staff work with faculty members who are designing and evaluating writing components of their courses, in addition to conducting writing workshops in those faculty members' classrooms, and reading and responding to manuscripts in preparation.

In all situations, Writing Center staff write with writers, never for them. They work to preserve the integrity of writers' ideas and plans, even as they challenge writers to interrogate and contextualize both their own and others ideas, language, and sources.

You can visit us in CE 310, peruse our website, connect with us via Zoom, or email us at [WritingCenter@csusb.edu](mailto:WritingCenter@csusb.edu) for more information.
