*some set up is required*

Up in the Californian mountains you own a small coffee shop. You saved all your money and poured it into this business, and sadly it's going under fast. The walls are water damaged and peeling, and the lights flicker occasionally. You repair what you can as money flow comes in and only can hire 1 employee... Me. You are waiting for your big chance when people start coming into your coffee shop besides your 2 regulars that come in to get a cup of coffee and read the paper. The coffee shop is hidden away on a road, and trees almost completely engulfing the exterior of the shop. People barely know the place exists, making it a great spot for people to spend time to read or hang about. Unfortunately they get coffee at a different cafe a short walk away since it has arguably better coffee than yours.

It's an extremely slow day. Heavy snow falls and people seek shelter as fast as possible. A large group of people that you haven't seen around town enters. "Must be tourists!" Sofia exclaims. "So happy to see everyone... Please Please sit anywhere you like!"
There were about 12 tourists all wearing ski equipment they all wore blue and white jackets except one that seemed like the leader wearing blue and black "Oi!, Quite cool in here" one of the tourists say "the other nod "sorry our heater is currently broken but we have hot delicious drinks" Sofia they pulls out a pen and paper to take the tourists requests the leader squinted at the waitress that wore a short dress with shorts underneath, cat ears and a tail, a half baked idea to attract more business "we will all like a Caramel Latte should be easy for even simpletons" Sofia took down the request and turned to start making the drinks, "Wait!" grabbing the tail that was luckily attached to the dress but is now hanging on by a few threads, "Nyaaa!" Sofia muttered, trying her best to keep up her cat girl act, "most of my friends cannot have cow's milk I refuse to harm cows even more than us pitiful humans have". Sofia asked softly "so would you lik---" she was cut off "anything but cow's milk, I could care less what it is" "You got it, Meowster," forcing a smile on her face. Sofia turned once more holding her tail to prevent it from being caught and lost just in case made her way to the back of the counter and turned to you with slight tears in her eyes, "Nya my tail is ripping... that mean lady over there pulled rweally hard on it" She hands you a crumpled paper and it says "13 Carmel lattes No Cow Mi_" the order wasn't finished but it's clearly visible of what the order entailed. *simple no problem we should have some oatmilk in the back fridge* you say to yourself you walk to the back Sofia is next to the fridge stroking her tail, tears start building and she walks out of your way and into the corner of the room you decide to comfort the sad cat girl "*its ok we can fix the tail after the work day is over*" "That's not its, that mean lady yelled at me and scared me quite a bit" You embrace the girl with a tight hug "*Can you help me with this and we can get them out of here faster, yeah?*" "*sniff sniff* you got it meowster, Nyaa, I'll grab the Carmel from the front and start grinding the espresso" The cat girl walks to the counter and trips over the hole in the floor from when snow leaked through "I'm ok!" she picks herself up and continues on You open the fridge and see the oatmilk, picking it up you figure out its empty, you shake it to make sure and a post it note falls "I O w e y o u N y a - Sofia" it was terribly written like it was written in a rush You meet up with the cat girl hard at work "*you used all the Oatmilk and didn't tell me!*" whisper yelling "Oops I forgot" Giving her iconic cat girl pose with to fist pointed down and one leg raised, she moved the higher fist and gave 2 gentle pats on her head "*no matter I go across the street and get more*" you attempt to open the door and its blocked by a wall of snow, the door wouldn't budge The boss tourist walks up to you "is there a problem with our drinks?" slightly raising her voice mid sentence you decide to retreat to your loyal, (not so helpful at the moment) employee "*Sofia get down here*" both you and the girl crouch behind the counter "*I can't get more Oatmilk, we are snowed in what do we do?*" "maybe give them regular milk maybe they won't notice ......... Nya?" You decide that is your only option at the moment so you give it a go You hand a fresh Caramel Latte to Sofia, she walks with a rhythmic sway and arrives at the leader and hands her the drink "Here is your dwink Meowster!" the tourist takes a sip and spits the piping hot contents on Sofia "What fool do you take me for this is without a doubt cow's milk" with a slight bow "sorry meow-- I'll go and fi- it" holding back tears as she walks away a few steps in she trips as she got distracted trying to process her feelings "look they can barely make a drink AND they can barely walk too" the tourist start to give off giggles in Sofia's direction Sofia decides to crawl the rest of the way to the back of the counter "They knew it was cow's milk... *sniff sniff* what do we do they knew *sniff sniff* it was cow's milk" You try your best to think of a solution and then the post it note with almost no adhesive falls slowly toward the floor until it lands on Sofia's chest "I O w e y o u N y a - Sofia" Then it hit you "I got it" exclaim silently Sofia perks up to hear your new idea "*follow me to the back*" the 2 workers stand up and start walking to the back, the post it note once again falls to the floor Once in the back you asked Sofia to sit down on a chair you grab a seat and a white bucket used to store packets of coffee grounds and filters You dump out the contents leaving the bucket empty Sofia stares at you trying to figure out what you are doing you place the bucket near Sofia you move the chair closer and look at Sofia in the eyes and say "*I'm sorry*" You untie her apron... "You're Firing me!!!" "*no no no*" you continue to untie the apron and set it aside moving the straps of the pink checkered maid dress off Sofia's shoulders and then removing the bra off her breasts "NYAAA, I mean wait your going to get the milk from me!!!!" "*KEEP IT DOWN... there is no other choice*" you place the bucket on Sofia's lap and lifted her breasts one at a time over the bucket with each touch Sofia gave off a small gasp "*Please try to keep quiet and close your eyes I don't think you want to see this*" She complies with full faith in your words You grab the first breast and try to figure out what to do as its all foreign to you you start squeezing and pinching and something comes out Sofia as a reaction let off a shy *Nyaa* You continue squeezing as drops of milk start to fall in the bucket there are drips in the bucket and drips from snow falling in you realize that it make take a while at this rate and start going faster "Meowster...Meowster not so rough" Breath escapes her mouth as you continue steaming up as the air is cold You have a good amount and decide to start making a test Latte You hand it off to the leader "what happened to that girl?" "*she's on break right now*" "well let's see if you can get it right" She takes a sip and smiles "WOW very good" she passes it to the other tourists "keep it coming" you run to the back "*Sophie we did it*" Sofia is sprawled out on the chair and removed the rest of her clothes except her underwear, panting and red as can be "*i'll need some more later try to relax*" as you walk back to the counter to make more lattes you hear very faintly "Meowster..." You made about half of the drinks and depleted your supply of milk walking back to the back room Sofia happily sits in her chair wide eyed locked on you "*Here we go again ... are you red---*" Sofia snatches the bucket from you and puts it into position and closes her eyes and voluntarily holds the bucket you focus on the milk Sofia squirms in her chair a little bit as you go as you pull the bucket away "ohhh... Nyaaa.... don't stop neow" "*I have enough*" "Oh", as a last ditch effort Sofia strikes her iconic cat girl pose only wearing her cat ears and underwear, her breasts give a slight bounce as she sharply moved you sigh put down the bucket and go in for a hug as you move closer Sofia moves swiftly in for a kiss, catching you off guard As she moves her lips away from yours all that can be hears is a faint "Nyaa" she lets go and happy jumps back to her chair You make and delivery the remaining drinks "these are the best Lattes we ever had, I will make sure that everyone hears about this" conveniently a snowplow came by and freed the door letting the tourists leave before they walk out the leader walks up to you and asks "what kind of milk was that?" you give a smile and say "*not cow's milk that's for sure*" your Coffee shop started gain a lot of fame and popularity for serving "not cow's milk lattes" People claim to hear a cat in the backroom and when asked about it you simply say "*its my lovely pet Sof-- I mean mittens you can't see her tho since having a cat roam the lobby would be a health violation heh heh*", kicking the door shut to keep your secret secret Next to the door as it shuts a pink checkered dress hangs on the doorframe with a tail hanging by a few threads along with an apron and a cat ear headband
