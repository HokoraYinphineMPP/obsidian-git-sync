# Chapter 2: Numerical Data Types
###### Data types
what they are
the data types used to represent numbers


###### variables
what they are 
declaring and defining them
## Background
represent different types of calues depending on task. *C++* able to represent numerical and character values using specific data types.
## Definition
Values in programming have a specific data type that determins size it takes in memory and type of value that is stored.

## Numerical Data Types
### integer values
|c++ keyword|size of type|range|
|int|4 bytes|-2147483648 to 2147483647
### Floating Point values
