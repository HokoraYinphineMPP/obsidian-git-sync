This week you will learn about mathematical statements. You will learn how to construct mathematical statements and begin learning how to determine the truthness of such statements.

**Module Objective(s):** The module objectives listed below support and align with the stated Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs), are measurable, and clearly describe what you will learn and be able to do upon successful completion of this module. By the end of this module you will be able to:

-   **MO1**. Understand and identify mathematical statements.  (CLO1)
-   **MO2**. Construct molecular statements using the logical connectives: conjuction, disjunction, implication, biconditional, and negation.  (CLO1)
-   **MO3**. Identify the hypothesis and conclusion in an implication and understand the truthness/falsity of implications.  (CLO1)
-   **MO4**. Construct the converse and contrapositive of implications.  (CLO1)
-   **MO5**. Translate between English-language statements and symbolic logic.  (CLO1)

**Agenda:** The purpose of the instructional materials included in this module is to reinforce learning of the content that supports the stated objectives and are to be used to help you complete the learning activities. Below is a list of instructional materials, activities, and assessments that will help you achieve the learning objectives for this module.
