![[Pasted image 20220920151923.png]]


This week you will learn about binomial coefficients. Binomial coefficients will arise in three-different ways for us: number of bit-strings of a given weight, number of lattice paths, coefficients of binomial expansions. 

**Module Objective(s):** The module objectives listed below support and align with the stated Course Outcomes (CO), are measurable, and clearly describe what you will learn and be able to do upon successful completion of this module. By the end of this module you will be able to:

-   **MO1**. Examine the relationship between bit-strings and binomial coefficients. (CO4)
-   **MO2**. Examine the relationship between lattice paths and binomial coefficients. (CO4)

**Agenda:** The purpose of the instructional materials included in this module is to reinforce learning of the content that supports the stated objectives and are to be used to help you complete the learning activities. Below is a list of instructional materials, activities, and assessments that will help you achieve the learning objectives for this module.

-   Watch the learning videos in this module
-   Read Section 1.2: Binomial Coefficients
-   Complete the Check Your Understanding Questions with Edfinity.
-   Review Module Wrap Up

**Grades and Evaluating Criteria:** Refer to syllabus.
