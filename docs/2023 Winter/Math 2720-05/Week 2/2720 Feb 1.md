	Sequences
		1) list of #'s
		2) graph
		3) closed form
		4) recursive form

#### 4) Write the first 8 terms of the following sequence: $a_{1} = 3, a_{n+1}=a_{n}+2$
$\left\{3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17\right\}$

#### 5) Write the first 8 terms of the following sequence: $a_{1}=1,\ a_{n+1}\ =\ 3a_{n}$
$\left\{1,3,9,27,81,243,729,2187\right\}$

#### 6) Give the following sequence in **closed form**: $1,\ 8,\ 15,\ 22,\ 29,...$
$7n+1$
##### Now give the sequence in **recursive form**.
$a_{1}=1`;`a_{n+1}=a_{n}+7$

#### 7) Give the following sequence in **closed form**: $1,\ 4,\ 9,\ 16,\ 25,\ 36,...$
$a_{n}=n^{2}$
##### Now give the sequence in **recursive form**.
$a_{1}=1`;`a_{n+1}=a_{n}+\left(2n+1\right)$

#### 8) Give the following sequence in **closed form**: $1,\ 2,\ 6,\ 24,\ 120,\ 720,...$
$a_{n}=n!$
##### Now give the sequence in **recursive form**.
$a_{1}=1`;`a_{n+1}=a_{n}\left(n+1\right)$
