# Japanese immigrants
1895-1910 biggest wave of Japanese immigrants
in japan, the industrial revolution is called the meiji restoration.
the rising power of industrialists in japan caused a huge wave of japanese immigrants to america.
the japanese who left japan to america left because of **land**.
private land ownership in japan is super hard. (even if you were wealthy its still hard to get land)

the naturalization act prevented Chinese from becoming citizens. 
Californias started to push the government to apply the same restrictions to japanese people too
the federal govt wouldnt give in
