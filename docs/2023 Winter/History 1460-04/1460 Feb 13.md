in japan, the industrial revolution is called the meiji restoration.
the rising power of industrialists in japan caused a huge wave of japanese immigrants to america.
the japanese who left japan to america left because of **land**.
private land ownership in japan is super hard. (even if you were wealthy its still hard to get land)

the naturalization act prevented Chinese from becoming citizens. 
Californias started to push the government to apply the same restrictions to japanese people too
the federal govt wouldnt give in

most people from Japan come in with money and a plan.
they intend to live in America.

they start passing laws that sound like they try to restrict the japanese, but it has many loop holes.

those are called **Paper Tigers**

theyre a way to keep hotheads against japanese pacified, while keeping japanese people their freedoms.
