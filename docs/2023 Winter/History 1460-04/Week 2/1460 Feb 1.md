idea of importing indentured servants from England
theyre people who are in debt for about 1 or 2 years.
most people aren't even in debt and join in for "new opportunity" to become a land owner since England's land has been mostly taken by nobels.
indentured servants only cost 30 shillings.
if indentured servants agree to do forced labor for a bit of time, they get their travel across atlanta paid, and get land at the end of the contract. 
initial indenture went from 2 to 4 years, then later 7 years of forced work.
indenture contrancts were now usually 4-7 years.
