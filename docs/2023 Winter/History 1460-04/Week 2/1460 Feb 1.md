sugar plantation main reason for buying slaves currently.

Jamestown was recovered because of growth of tobacco.
new tobacco plantation 
tobacco has to be constantly attentended to and requires constant labor
John sold his crop yield for 500 shillings
collonists called him the one that saved Jamestown making tobacco
slave go for 300 shillings from the carabeans and last only a few months. 

idea of importing indentured servants from England
theyre people who are in debt for about 1 or 2 years.
most people aren't even in debt and join in for "new opportunity" to become a land owner since England's land has been mostly taken by nobels.
indentured servants only cost 30 shillings.
if indentured servants agree to do forced labor for a bit of time, they get their travel across atlanta paid, and get land at the end of the contract. 
initial indenture went from 2 to 4 years, then later 7 years of forced work.
indenture contrancts were now usually 4-7 years.
you want the servants to live for about 1 year.
if they live out their 4 years, you have to give them the land, plus tools, seeds, etc.
most indentured servants died before their contract died.

its high risk high reward.
people want them to stay healthy to survive for 3 years, by year 4, they are downright brutal to indentured servants to kill them.

any servants who survive become competition for growing tobacco

by the 1650's the tobacco price plummeted, because the life expectancy of Jamestown shot up.
it shot up because they made Jamestown healthier over time. 

now it's harder to recruite indentured servants now. 

people started switching to slaves.

people in Barbados moved to south carolina and brought slaves.
slaves and indentured servants often worked together

the poorer planters were being held down by richer planters because it helps control the price of tobacco

Nathaniel Bacon is a nobelmen from aristocracy.
he goes to the governer and requests to own the land
Berkerly treats Nathaniel badly because he doesn't want to lose his land

interior planterns are typically more poorer

western planters were more rich.

Bacon doesn't know about the divide that Berkerly has created.

Bacon catches on to how Berkeley is trying to kill off the interior planters where bacon set up his plantation by using the indians to kill them off.

Bacon confronts Berkeley.

In Europe, they are raised with two classes: lords, and commoners.

nobels are expected to be the proctectors of the people.
commoners are groomed from birth to follow what nobels tell them to do.

the interior plantern farmers group up with Bacon and attack Berk
