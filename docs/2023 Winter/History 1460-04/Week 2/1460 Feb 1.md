# The Rise and Fall of Africanized Slavery
sugar plantation main reason for buying slaves currently.

short supply of gold and silver in Virginia.
very humid
Salt water contamination.
tldr: jamestown is not healthy
average lifespan is 40 years.

Jamestown was recovered because of growth of tobacco.
new tobacco plantation 
tobacco has to be constantly attentended to and requires constant labor
John sold his crop yield for 500 shillings
collonists called him the one that saved Jamestown making tobacco
slave go for 300 shillings from the carabeans and last only a few months. 

idea of importing indentured servants from England
theyre people who are in debt for about 1 or 2 years.
most people aren't even in debt and join in for "new opportunity" to become a land owner since England's land has been mostly taken by nobels.
indentured servants only cost 30 shillings.
if indentured servants agree to do forced labor for a bit of time, they get their travel across atlanta paid, and get land at the end of the contract. 
initial indenture went from 2 to 4 years, then later 7 years of forced work.
indenture contrancts were now usually 4-7 years.
you want the servants to live for about 1 year.
if they live out their 4 years, you have to give them the land, plus tools, seeds, etc.
most indentured servants died before their contract died.

its high risk high reward.
people want them to stay healthy to survive for 3 years, by year 4, they are downright brutal to indentured servants to kill them.

any servants who survive become competition for growing tobacco

by the 1650's the tobacco price plummeted, because the life expectancy of Jamestown shot up.
it shot up because they made Jamestown healthier over time. 

now it's harder to recruite indentured servants now. 

people started switching to slaves.

people in Barbados moved to south carolina and brought slaves.
slaves and indentured servants often worked together

the poorer planters were being held down by richer planters because it helps control the price of tobacco

Nathaniel Bacon is a nobelmen from aristocracy.
he goes to the governer and requests to own the land
Berkerly treats Nathaniel badly because he doesn't want to lose his land

interior planterns are typically more poorer

western planters were more rich.

Bacon doesn't know about the divide that Berkeley has created.

Bacon catches on to how Berkeley is trying to kill off the interior planters where bacon set up his plantation by using the indians to kill them off.

###### Bacon confronts Berkeley.

In Europe, they are raised with two classes: lords, and commoners.

nobels are expected to be the proctectors of the people.
commoners are groomed from birth to follow what nobels tell them to do.

the interior plantern farmers group up with Bacon and attack the indians.

most indians were peaceful with the English, however Bacon attacked all indians.

Berkeley told the governor that Bacon is a rebel for attacking the indians.

Bacon was now called a rebel by people.

###### Bacon Razes Jamestown

Bacon and the interior plantern farmers attack Jamestown

Jamestown completly destroyed.
interior win
a month later after they win, Bacon dies from disintary (swamp disease)


Bacon was a nobelman, and he was kept at arms length.
rule #1: treat nobelman with respect from now on.
rule #2: let the midlevel planterns to have a voice in the government now.
rule #3: indentured servants arent wanted anymore. use slaves now.

Slaves are more risky due to much higher risk of revolts.
The poor know that they have to show unity against slaves to prevent slaves from revolting. so it ends up being a huge unifier between everyone.
racism starts to get a foothold. by 1650, there are now laws against african americans by preventing them from owning guns, etc.

by the 1660s, they say baptism will not free slaves from slavery.

Bacon's rebellion changed everything.

by 1680, slavery was now the new standard instead of indentured servants.

Virginia made more stability by importing women from England, and allowed voting now.

Women wanted to come because the men were landowners.
by the 1680s and 1690s, the balance between women and men mostly balanced out
went from 9:1 men to women, to 9:8 men to women.

Jemmy leads a slave rebellion of about 20 slaves. They attacked a store with weapons.
They now went from plantation to plantation and gain numbers.
Now the carolina militia finds them.
###### Stono Rebellion
the militia wins against the slaves.

the stono rebellion signaled a warning to the plantation owners.
they started to put heavy restrictions against slaves, including adding laws preventing slaves from earning money and learning how to read. 

newer plantern farmers are facing a social barrier because the amount of slaves you have, the more important you are.
