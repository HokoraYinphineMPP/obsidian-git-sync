## Rough Trancrpt
Economy is more or less help that's basically the line for unemployment so he wanted to get those numbers down he wanted to get more people into the economy but also he needed to get the econom y that was stagnant scene that was the Great Depression no Roosevelt tried to fix the Great Depression with the New Deal Social programs and work programs but what was the failure was it that the program wouldn't work why did that new deal not pull America out of the depression he simply didn't spend enough and it wasn't him all fairness he wanted more money into it it was Congress Congress didn't want to spend the money on all of this so they were a little reluctant to throw the amount of money that would be needed to get the government however World War II and the wartime economy was booming enter the '70s and the economic crisis and how Reagan interprets the past he looks at Roosevelt 's program of them as social assistance programs and jobs programs to help people and said well that didn't work what didn't work military spending rather than spending money on social assistance program which he really couldn't sell the phone you wouldn't be able to get the amount of money he needed selling social so the social programs for push the side in fact most of them got slash they got their funding would reduce why he was spending a lot more on military spending we had to get the money from somewhere part of it came from budget in other areas like welfare homelessness programs jobs programs things like this end up getting cut he had some successes there but it was slow going at first this new economic system really isn't a new one it's been done before the person who was the brainchild behind the New Deal John Maynard kind Cape Pines and he laid the foundation for what became known as Tunisian economics based on his last name economics basically is fixed the government or fix the economy rather using government spending okay that's that's what amazing is they also call it supply side economics if you are an economic class you find me an econ major you'll hear about supply-side economics quite a bit over there okay so this has been done before but in this period of time Reagan is taking it his own directions so where Roosevelt had the New Deal Reagan has something that becomes labeled Reaganomics that would also gets a couple other names Reagan says the way to do this is to grow money at the top and then let it trickle all the way down synonymous however as trickle down economics started to work the people at the top who are already rich got really rich the people who were in the middle were the middle class during the 70s had shrunk small part of America compared to what it had been before middle class under the lower middle class like somebody opened an umbrella and was sitting there over the people on the trip le Free the trickle just wasn't making it all the way down so yeah it was nice in theory it really caused the Resurgence of the middle class if you were middle class in America You Love rating reason I'm ready for it come on everybody else is getting triple where's mine but they didn't get any so it was like there was an invisible barrier for the people in the lower class the middle class did Fabulous the lower class did not the working people the blue collar labor the urban takes off one of the first programs that he starts throwing money at it's called the Strategic Defense i is anybody know what the nickname of this program was Star Wars very good yes Reagan came into office in 1981 in 1977 one of the most influential movies in modern history was put out into the theaters and it had a huge imp act yeah Star Wars isn't dead they still keep coming out with new movies related to that Star Wars world so Star Wars of course better all right good okay so Reagan being an actor and understanding the real power that movies can have in people's lives really keys in on Star Wars and starts getting these ideas of pushing the technology people are inspired by the lasers and the the fighting going on and you know it's kind of a underdog coming up and winning npn that's sort of the big theme of this well then came out the secret right after he took office and the sequel was if anything even bigger than the original it was one of the great sequels in history very few movies actually have good sequels but this was one where the sequel was probably better than than the original and that was The Empire Strikes Back but The Empire Strikes Back doesn't just inspire people it gives him a visible thing to use in his own characterization of the Cold War all of a sudden the boogeyman that they've been selling for the Cold War the Soviet Union has suddenly become the evil empire and if you take a look at Star Wars Star Wars is influence by the Cold War but it also influences the Cold War how do I mean well when Luke and Darth Vader are fighting with each other what color is Darth Vader's lightsaber red Soviet Union what color is Luke's blue now later by the time he gets to the Return of the Jedi he then has a green one that he's made but yeah he had a clue lightsaber so here you had the red versus the blue in this big Showdown and Reagan will end up delivering one of the most famous presidential addresses in history became known as the evil empire spe ech where he was literally talking about the Soviet Union in the same language that you would talk about Star Wars he was portraying the Soviets as the evil empire who want to conquer basically the Galaxy and it's up to us to stand up to them we have a moral responsibility to stand up to them and this became part of the momentum of him getting his military programs approved okay so this was one of them and they even nicknamed this one Star Wars according to the history books this ultimately Ended as a failure but didn't really first of all what is Strategic Defense Initiative it was a system in the satellites to shoot down any nuclear missiles that might be fired at the United States especially Soviet ones shoot them down before they can blow up and what you what would you shoot him down with lasers pew pew which is why it was called Star Wars okay satellites could they put them up into space at this point in the 80s yeah matter of fact they had just started a new program in NASA called the space shuttle which was specifically designed to carry to carry cargo up into space and turn it loose so we were putting up huge amounts of satellites throughout the 80s and what about the Laser Technology could they make a laser that was strong enough to destroy a nuclear missile yeah they actually saw that one too the Laser Technology the money that they put into that was huge and schools like MIT Caltech Stanford USC UCLA Berkeley and Harvard we're really the big movers and shakers in the laser world so they solved it they threw enough money at the programs of the universities to solve those and then they went on and applied those why didn't they get it to work well here's the problem do you know how fast the nuclear missile reaches at its peak what kind of speeds it can go $25,000 miles per hour that's as fast as f*** okay so if you're going to shoot down something that is moving 25,000 miles per hour how hard is that to hit well let me put it in this terms do you know how fast a bullet from a rifle travels 3000 mph or less some less but say a high-powered rifle 3000 miles per hour this is traveling eight times that speed yikes so what is the big problem with SBI they couldn't get a fast enough computer to make it work but let's look at this today that only needed a faster computer in order to make it work everything else the technology was there you want to know something really freaky you see this this has a computer in it that is so far beyond that the computer in a smartphone could easily run that system do we have those up in the sky today if you ask the government they will say no I would say they're lying that's my personal voice I think this is alive and well I think they put it up there I could be wrong but that's my guess okay so SDI It ultimately was a money sink for $15 billion dollars to be dumped into the industry wow just on this program alone that's a lot of money especially if they're saying well it failed but didn't fail even on the surface okay let's say we didn't put any satellites up there that can shoot down nuclear missiles was it really a failure we developed better space going technology we developed better ways to deliver satellites we developed better satellites to put into space which now form things like telling Communications when you make phone calls sometimes they go over satellites global Positioning Systems how many of you have used Google Maps or some other kind of navigation system on your phone well the satellites tell you where you are so we've got all of that coming out of this so this is really the groundwork for other big advances that come along later also what about lasers okay so we made big powerful lasers but Laser Technology as a whole Advanced dramatically after this what can you do with lasers now manufacturing with laser Precision laser cutting also what about Surgical you want to get your eyes fixed they've got a laser procedure for correcting your vision they also have one that can actually reattach your retina if you have a detached retina that used to make it blonde now they can weld it back in place with a laser they have Micro lasers that they can put inside of you through little slits and do all the stuff in in a lesson invasive way than cutting you wide open so all of that is technology that was forwarded by this program so it wasn't entirely a failure now then we moved to the really big money sink still 17 came out in this period of time that was known as the stealth fighter even though it wasn't really a fighter it was more of a tactical bomber but it was pretty much invisible this thing was one of the most incredible aircraft ever created maybe the most incredible aircraft ever created that plane what color is it it looks black doesn't it it's not if it were black and you saw that up in the night sky you would actually be able to see it you can see a black plane this one was actually programmed by a supercomputer to pixelate the coating of it so that it took in various shades of different types of gray blending them together in a way that made it just fade out of existence you look up in the night sky you can't see this you can see where the stars might disappear in its silhouette but you cannot see the color you can't see that plane that was incredible and that's just the color what is stealth aircraft what are they known for why are they stealthy right they can't be seen on radar this was the most advanced stealth aircraft ever created at this point and reason being it had the radar cross section of a bird a large bird maybe a goose or an eagle but a bird now if you see a bird on radar you're not going to detect it as an airplane even if it's traveling 600 miles an hour okay so was this program successful absolutely we made 20 of them the problem is it was incredibly expensive initially we had plan to make something like somewhere between 1 and 200 of these and they were supposed to be 600 million dollars each well we only made 20 of them but we were still committed to the research to pay off the defense contractors so they actually made about 20 of them at a price of about two and a half to three billion dollars each each yeah that's what it cost to build a destroyer have we used those in war anybody know anyone at all Yeah we actually have we used them in Iraq both times because they couldn't be seen they were great for taking out the f-117s and b2's were both used to take out the air defenses after they killed all of Iraq's air defenses then they just started sending in B-52's and heavy carpet bombing place so it was really a very dramatic thing but what was this in the terms of the day the Cold War why is that significant well previous to this aircraft coming out Russia had just spent the equivalent of roughly 50 billion dollars expanding their radar Network across their country they had just upgraded it and created this radar net to detect any aircraft that might come into their air space and just a year after they announce okay this is done we've got the best air defenses in the world this comes out they just spent how much on radar and here's a ship they can't even see on it thanks so now think of this in the terms of the Soviets perspective we were working on a system that we say didn't work but even they are suspecting it did that one which shoots down nuclear missiles so the Soviets can attack us but we can shoot down what they attack or we can just hit him in a strike that they can't stop we have first strike capabilities and Reagan's aggressive language toward the Soviet Union made them genuinely afraid that we might be heading toward a nuclear exchange they were scared of this skull and this is one big reason why they start angling away from the cold war and start this process of heating up defrosting the Cold War and essentially ending it this is going to lay the groundwork for ultimately the end of the Soviet Union the breakup okay what has incredible consumer implications as well and not just all the models that people would build them and there were a lot of those they had such complex systems in there that if you were to put all the dials you know how when you look in an aircraft's cockpit there's like dials everywhere and switches everywhere and you're going man how can anybody keep track of all this well it would have been 10 times worse on this aircraft than any other aircraft that had ever been made so instead of that they came up with the system of having each the pilot and the co-pilot have three screens and the screens all you had to do is just touch your selections on those screens and it would pop up the control screen that you wanted and then you could back out of it you know what that laid the ground wire groundwork for touch screens on your phone came about because of this the B2 created that technology so all sorts of military funding I've only gone into a couple of the big programs but there are a lot of other ones okay military funding is skyrocketing in this period of time and anyone when he comes in things are a little sluggish by 82 people are going is this going to work we don't see any difference 83 recession over economy booming it was working and it was working big so by that point everything was rolling everything was moving and the people in the middle and the people on the top are going this is great lots of jobs better pay everything's getting better the people in the bottom are going we're not getting better you forgotten about us here going about their daily lives like the people on the bottom don't exist so they just kind of get ignored the wealthy massive the wealthy benefit massively because of this they are becoming really rich and a lot of that upcoming middle class is doing very very well too and many of them will become hugely affluent as well you think being a Microsoft product they would have come up with a way not to do that okay so the people at the top and the people in the middle are benefiting hugely now keep in mind that the people who are now in that middle class getting wealthier period those are the same people who in the 60s were protesting the system marching out against how the tyranny of capitalism was ruining the world and now are they on that same bandwagon no most of them have jumped into the hyper consumerism going up this is what life's all about I protested this I shouldn't have been protesting this I should have been embracing it and so they become ultimately the huge symbol of hypocrisy in America the protesters of the 60s have become the upcoming Professionals of the '80s and they get labeled young upcoming professionals or some people would call them young urban professionals but ultimately the name they will get lashed on to them is yuppie young upcoming professional yup so they become yuppies now whether or not you know what a yuppie is you know what a yuppie is I can show you what a yuppie is oops let's talk about the criticism that's going on and then I'll show you I've got a picture of you hold on okay the trickle down economics because the people on the bottom weren't getting the Trickle it started to get a lot of negative press and one big name that it gets labeled was voodoo economics so Reaganomics trickle down economics voodoo economics they're all referring to the same basic policy but who's that explain trickle-down economics to me again grow money at the top and let it trickle down where's that money stand at the top and he says now try to get with the straight face yeah the people at the top or the ones engineering it and they're saying yeah I give us that trickle down and it's just not trickling down far enough and then you hear you see here this champagne film you guys have seen these probably before right where you poor champagne in the top one and it spreads down to the next level the next level in the whole idea is it's supposed to fill up the entire Fountain but they didn't put enough champagne in it to go all the way down so the trickle down wasn't trickling so there was a lot of social criticism to this program especially from the people on the bottom now Reagan will capitalize on some positive issues to Kickstart his presidency that will get him off on the right foot as well and one of those big ones what was one of the biggest things at the end of the seventies that people were really bothered about hostages in Iran they had been there for a year and a half and every day Iran trotted him out in front of the cameras burned an American flag showed the hostages blindfolded and and tied up and then they shouted death to America burned in effigy of Carter and went back in and repeated the same thing next day tomorrow same time let's go and they do it all over again and that was just constant every time on the Nightly News oh another protest in in Iran happened today so you know people were constantly inundated with it and they felt frustrated well the day Reagan takes office these same day January 20th 1981 people get to see this the hostages were released from Iran and they were flown out to Athens where they got off the plane here switched over to another plane that brought him back to the US the hostages were free and the interpretation of the American people is man they were so afraid Ronald Reagan would come after him they turn them loose before he even took office or on the day he took office not even give him the chance well that was something that was encouraged by the government they wanted that to be the interpret Carter had negotiated this and Reagan's people actually man aged stall the release of them they were there several months longer than they needed to be because they wanted this as a big visual on the day he took office starting things on the right foot now could Carter have complained about that given that he was the one who really negotiated it absolutely that could have been a great thing for him to campaign on too but ultimately he didn't why he wanted Reagan to be successful fixing America he felt like he had failed the American people when he left office he was actually crying in his farewell speech he felt like he had failed the people and so if this would get Reagan off on the right foot and he would be able to fix America if this is what it took he would keep his silence and let Reagan take credit for so we did but that also gives you a little insight into the character of the leaders too doesn't it Jimmy Carter was probably one of the leaders in American history who had the highest character he wasn't the best leader but he was probably the best person whoever took office and that saying something now Reagan created this system that created the Yuppie so let's take a look at what the yuppies look like now back to the young thing that's what yuppies look like you've seen them before you can see him down in Newport Beach right Costa Mesa Redondo Malibu go to any of those places you can see them and your reaction to them today is probably the same reaction a lot of people had of them back then yeah they have a hard life down there embracing conspicuous consumption they are wanting it you've heard that phrase if you've got it want it well that was very much alive and well in the eighties and people were flaunting left and right it wasn't enough just to have money they wanted to make sure everybody knew they had money they were spending it on massive mansions and Yachts and jets and supercars and whatever you can buy with money you want to buy an island go for it hey can speak use consumption and people would do that all of that was going on you guys know who Larry Ellison is CEO of Oracle big tech company up the Bay Area he's the guy who bought one of the Hawaiian Islands the whole island Lanai you bought the island I think that's what the fifth or sixth largest of the Hawaiian islands is Big he bought it so that's still very much alive and well yeah okay you mean that one yeah we haven't gotten to that one yet yes we're going to go through the music here very soon I'm sure you just saw all that but we'll go through it again okay so this culture of access conspicuous consumption is turning a lot of people against everything that's going on okay America's economy is improving for some people but it's not improving for others and for the people in the bottom who aren't getting any Improvement they're seeing the people at the top not only improved but want it and like grind it in how much better they are than the people on the bottom and they start treating them like crap yeah they're going to react to that and you start seeing a lot of social responses but probably the biggest was in music in the 70s you're starting to see this largely Urban working class culture that is reacting negatively to consumerism to capitalism to every piece of untrustworthy politician in office all of it they're hating it all and they say you know what we're tired of this and we just want to destroy the whole system Anarchy and musically this turns into anger frustration lashing out and with it you get the rise of the pumpkin 1982 was the first really big big year of punk it was rising in the 70s because of the frustration but then when they started seeing wealthy people get really wealthy and start to live a very aggressive flaunting lifestyle they became so disgusted with America they weren't alone and they had a big listening audience who were just as disgusted and frustrated as they were so Punk was on the rise hunk challenged religion it challenged politics it challenged Conformity and a society that was addicted to consumerism pop culture it hated it it saw it as bro kind of the way the Beat Generation saw the '50s plastic fake artificial it just wasn't real and rather than calling for improvement they're saying we should just tear the whole system down Burn It to the Ground start out of the ashes all over again Anarchy nihilism all of that is part of the punk approach to things politically charged you get groups like The Dead Kennedys anger frustration Anarchy you get groups like Black Flag unemployment and economic frustration you can see that with a lot of them Sex Pistols The Clash the Damned and a bunch of others one guy that became sort of the poster child of the punk movement was this guy Sid Vicious people who was contributing to the rise of the punk movement and in 1979 he died of a heroin overdose keep in mind that a big component of the punk movement was self-hatred loathing they were self-destructive they buried themselves in pain and problems and drugs and you know keep piling it on and so a lot of their destructive nature turned inward he was a good example of that dying of Heron a heroin overdose Sid Vicious became sort of the poster child of the Pokemon live fast Die Young fight for what you want make your voice heard and if you burn out along the way so be it there's nothing to live for anyway screw the whole system that's kind of punk in a nutshell that kind of frustration had a big impact in other areas as well but Punk was more influential than just the music style they gave rise to all sorts of new types of directions in music and one thing that was an outgrowth of the punk rock industry was the rise of New Wave New Wave was influenced by pump there was sort of a rebellion but at the same time it didn't have the same anger attached to it for the most part some of them were but there was they were heavily influenced by pop as well but what really influenced the new wave movement was something else a combination of two big things technology in instruments the new Rising technology is causing new changes in sounds that you can achieve with new instruments also women remember how we talked about the seventies and everything started changing for the women well the girls who grew up in the environment of the educational Amendments of 1972 Title Nine they had grown up through the '70s and now in the '80s they're going to be the punk rockers who then turn into the new waivers groups like The Go-Go's for example who started out as a punk group and then sort of became a popular way through other groups will focus on the technology and with that you get groups like Devo very electronically driven music pushing the boundaries of new sounds that the capabilities also you'll see Heavy Metal be affected by this guitars start sounding differently because they're coming up with all sorts of new sound effects that they can get guitars to do delay distortion law Reverb you name it they can do all kinds of different things and get new sounds out of it and so music evolves in the '80s in a way that was not really possible before it because they're simply able to make sounds that we're not possible possible before this affects a lot of different things but the frustration is also leading into other music types as well for example God the death Rock and Goth scenes will come heavy out of this same environment social mores they are objecting to they feel like Outsiders they are anti-conformists they hate that normal American society that Conformity that the pop culture is throwing on them all over again kind of sounds like the beatniks all over again doesn't it well it's not far off at least an attitude it inspires groups like of course the Cure you guys know who these are you know Robert Smith is some people do you ever see people dress like this today goth is still around it's not as prominent and and visible as it was back in the 80s but there are still people in that got sea that's something that is still alive another one that emerges is urban violence and anger the frustration over lawlessness that is rising as well as police brutality racism and a lot of the ongoing problems in the inner cities gangs are rising up challenging each other for territories because they're starting to take control of the drug trade and that's big money Wars of the '80s and 90s were brutal that was an ugly ugly time in the inner city and it affected music NWA how many of you have seen the movie did you like it they did a pretty good job didn't they yeah that was one where they didn't really take too many creative Liberties they didn't need to because the story was creative enough it was interesting but here you see NWA the rise of rap and hip hop also came out of this period of time and NWA these are the guys who took it from sort of an underground and made it huge now are they the first rap group no they had others who laid the groundwork before him Run DMC was one and there were others but these are the guys who really came out with an anger charged message it was anti-establishment it was critical of law enforcement talking about all the problems that they're having in the inner cities I mean it's all there basically what will become known as gangster rap will be an extension of what they established and a lot of them individually will go on to do other things significantly let's take a look at these guys Ice Cube he's an actor he's still acting today MC rent I think he died did he die I think he died Eazy-E he did die yellow he put out a solo album after the breakup he had one big hit I suppose you could call him a one hit wonder and that one has made him a massive living one song it gets used in movies it gets used in commercials all the time and if you heard it you would recognize it and then there's Dr Dre Dr Dre will go on to the biggest solo career of all of these guys and become a name in and of its own and then he will go on to do something else that affects all of you how many have them come on you know what I'm talking about two come on you're lying let's see him you know what I'm talking about right Beats headphones Beats by Dre those headphones everybody had to buy and they were good they weren't bad headphones but they had a style to them and they were being put out by somebody in the rap industry wrap and Hip Hop and that was something that a lot of people responded to because it had a heavy base component in it and that was good for hip hop listening to Hip Hop so Drake ends up selling his company to Apple for over a billion dollars yes or what okay I thought you died do you know what he's doing he retired yeah he was he was going to the guy I couldn't find really much about it it's like you faded you know okay but Eazy-E he came out with some solo stuff big hit during the '80s that you would probably recognize if you heard it today but these guys will spawn the next wave of Hip Hop that will take it into the future MC Hammer Dr Dre when he's solo Snoop Dogg all of these guys who really like the foundations of modern Hip Hop came out of these guys these guys were really the first big group to take hip hop to the next level so the frustration is causing a lot of creativity in the protesting through music so you see some people embrace the pop culture and other people rebelling against the pop culture but it has a big consumer effect whether you support it or not people are buying the stuff when you think of the '80s one big thing that comes to mind sports cars sports cars become common in the '80s and not just Corvettes we're talking Exotics Ferraris Lamborghinis Maseratis and the list goes on also you start seeing rules and Bentley and all the rest of those start rising up too excess it's not enough just to have a fast car you have to have one of the fastest cars you have to have an F40 you have to have a Porsche 959 Bill Gates bought one of those so did Paul Allen you guys know who they are right one of the founders of Microsoft Paul Allen also yeah and they both bought $959's the government wouldn't let him bring him into the country they were embargoed for 20 years on the docks and finally after 20 years they can bring him in as a classic car that don't apply to the same rules and now Bill Gates drives his to work his 959 is his daily his daily driver yeah it's kind of an interesting story but when people tend to think of the '80s in sports cars this is usually the one that comes to mind the Ferrari Testarossa becomes very iconic why was that one so popular why not one of the others why that one I mean it is kind of cool looking but why that one are there faster cars yes other cars that handle better yes it is a Ferrari and Ferrari definitely has that whole stallion image going with it yeah but there's another reason a pop culture reason Miami Vice this is the car that they drove in Miami Vice or at least one of the sports cars we drove but that show vaulted this car to a whole new level and all of a sudden everybody had to have the same car that Don Johnson was driving in Miami Vice it was basically for those of you unfamiliar with Miami Vice it was a couple of undercover cops who are narcs narcotics officers trying to break into the Miami drug scene and bring him down okay and they posed as drug dealers and they drove around in a Ferrari so that was kind of the gist of the movie or the well I guess they did make a movie of it but the series Okay so sports cars became big it became commonplace to see Exotics everywhere you can go down to your local coffee shop and see a Ferrari outside you could go to the grocery store and see a whole bunch of Porsche 911s in the parking lot you can see those all over the place everywhere you went they had much more presents in the 80s then they even do today today you might see a nice car every now and then you go down to Orange County to see a few more but it wasn't like that back then you saw him a lot is that a sports cars wherever you were okay another big thing that's going on is the rising electronics Industry through the 50s and 60s has started to really really boom and all of that came out of Stanford Stanford is where the microchip was invented that's why Silicon Valley is where it is today it built up around Stanford because that's where the people who knew about microchips were located and today it's still there Silicon Valley is in Northern California the new electronics bring some new consumer things that you take for granted today and one of them as mentioned before is this the dine attack 8000x now prior to this people in the 80s were putting cellular phones in their cars but having a truly portable one wasn't really a reality until this model and only really would buy this now this shot here of Michael Douglas talking on that that's from the movie Wall Street and basically it was a movie about Wall Street Traders who started embracing insider trading which became a big scandal in the 80s as well and then the whole system kind of came down collapsing well he was known for his excess he was one of those hyper-consuming people and here he is on the beach talking on his dynotech 8000x what is the nickname of this phone does anybody know the brick good yes this became known as the prick you see this that's a pretty big phone isn't it that's the small battery the big one took it out to about there only about 2 hours of standby so still not exactly practical in truth the first truly practical cell phone was the Motorola flip phone you guys know that one right I have one I bought it back then and I used it back then it was a great phone it would fit in your pocket even with the extended battery it would still it would be a bulge but it would still fit in your pocket but that was really the first truly practical cell phone that became available to a Master group everybody started buying those and then technology got better the Sloan's got Capone's got smaller easier to fit in various places some would be flip phones some would be regular phones and then they will go to a whole new level now other things that take off in consumer electronics video games this is pong you guys have heard upon yeah it's it's sort of like playing tennis back and forth you just hit this little dot back and forth between the paddles okay so hung okay this is going to date me I had pong when I was a kid and then I had to follow on the Atari 2600 and then I have to follow on the NES Nintendo Entertainment System yes I had I still have two of them go figure yeah hey rise to personalization of computer products yes it's a gaming platform but personal computers are also going to come out at the same time and Atari the creators of this pong game here are also one of the driving forces behind the rise of personal computers with the Atari 400 and the Atari 800 later on others will start getting in as well Radio Shack puts out their own version they have a their in-house brand Tandy and they put out the TRS 80 that is the Tandy Radio Shack model lady and it gets an unfortunate name the trash lady yeah yeah he didn't really want one of those but meanwhile another computer company jumps into the foray and starts making a name for themselves Apple they come up with the apple one it is popular they come up with the Apple too it was incredibly popular then they came out with the two c and everybody loved it so that one's rising up in the PC World however it was IBM that really put this particular technology on the map how many of you have a a Mac today okay how many have a PC okay the PCS are still on this architecture the max are still on the macro architecture so this split that's going on here between Apple and IBM is still something that is a Mainstay in computer technology today now I have one of those too this is going to be kind of a walk down memory lane for me in a lot of ways I get to see my life as I get better technology along the way up team well by the late '80s I I respect to clean an adult I suppose I was in college and 89 so okay now initially the PCS had just floppy drives and they would usually have two of them but the pcxt was the first Model to incorporate that a hard drive oh my gosh it was big it was 10 MB you have music files bigger than that don't you yeah 10 MB is nothing today back then it was huge that was enormous that would you be able to put tons of programs and not have to load them in by floppies anymore just fire it up and accent wow this is great well 10 makes becomes 20 minutes and we're off vector graphics still not great and then came this Steve Jobs was one of the most brilliant people in Tech he was also a tyrant a dictator and it was rumored that he was that he had a drug problem too frequently take something to stay up for long periods of time he was known as somebody who would stay up for days on end and so some people thought he was amphetamines other people thought he was on coke but he definitely had the attitude problems to go with it okay and he would push his people relentlessly oftentimes they were pushed to work 18 20 24 hours straight without going home but ultimately he came out with this this changed everything the rise of McIntosh you know all those icons you have on your phones this is where they were created this is who invented them Steve Jobs he's the one who created all the stuff that we use today computers and phones all of it tablets he was the brainchild behind this stuff and Macintosh is where it started McIntosh created a system for computing that is still used today and yes I had one of those that's the one I took to college actually this is the Mac one I had the Mac plus the Mac plus had a little bit different configuration but it still looked a lot like that anyway like I said another big innovation that's coming out in the spare time cable cable television before this everybody had rabbit ears they're all trying to get the right reception and sometimes it just wasn't awesome well cable changed all that all of a sudden you don't have to have reception it always comes in clear and also there were channels on Cable that were available that you could not get over the air and cable is becoming more and more common one of the channels that made a big difference from a consumer standpoint is the way the music industry is presenting music they're not only giving you the audio they start including a visual component music videos and the channel MTV Music Television music videos were off and that early generation was actually really kind of fun videos kind of suck now but back then they were pretty interesting another one is all those people who are frustrated when they watch Network television and they put a movie out they saw in the theaters but they censor it and they cut out all the adult parts and they put in advertising everywhere and it just breaks up the movie and people go I just want the movie Let me see it well a company came along to deliver exactly that home box office HBO and when they couple that with the rising VCR technology that was becoming increasingly popular all of a sudden people are saying wow I can get HBO get an uncut movie the way it was shown in the theaters and recorded on my VCR I can have my own collection of movies at home no more of this commercials you can relate to that right yeah commercials are still something to bug us you don't want to be watching your movie and they say I'm falling and I can't get up yes this was a way for cable to bring more consumerism to America and Beyond the Cold War also influenced a lot of movies for example Firefox I knew Russian plane that changes everything in America is falling behind technology technologically so we have to send a spy over to steal the plane where are we behind technologically no we were actually quite a bit ahead but people believe that we were behind so this actually sold well now if you want to see something funny watch this movie it actually wasn't a bad movie on the storyline but if the part where they start flying the special effects are just awful it's like somebody's taking a plane bouncing it on the end of a stick wish frankly they probably work it just looks like it's bouncing up and down like this instead of just flying smoothly and so it just it doesn't look right technology be questioned what happens if computers become too smart what happens if AI takes over this is reflected in this one where a Matthew Broderick is a hacker who tries to play a game on a system he thinks is a gaming company and he actually in inadvertently gets a government computer playing a war game that tries to launch the missiles at the Soviet Union yikes and it doesn't know the difference between a game or real life so this suspicion of technology is something going along in this period of time too you probably have seen the Terminator or at least know the basics right same basic theme anti AI what happens if AI gets too smart and we become the bad guys ex machina you guys seen that movie that was out not that long ago maybe well in your lifetime at least another suspicion of AI Red Dawn you want to talk about unreal movies high school kids leader Rebellion against an invasion of the Soviet Union and Cuba of the United States and they inspire a big wave of resistance that ultimately Wyndham the War I buy that Patrick Swayze okay enough said Chuck Norris campy but played on Star Wars basically Dan and Aykroyd and Chevy Chase are recruited as would be spies they're actually decoys but their job is to go in there take control of a Russian missile fired at the United States reason they want to test their new shoot down the shoot down with the Laser Technology STI only problem they miss whoops now there's a nuclear missile heading in America you want to see what happens watch the movie This one is suddenly become relevant again hasn't it how many saw the new one it was good wasn't it it was actually a pretty good movie yeah but Continuum this is still something that's hanging around but it kind of gives you the impact of how Big Top Gun was Top Gun was one of the biggest movies to come out of the '80s it was very very popular this one was a disturbing movie Miracle Mile basically they found out that nuclear missiles from Russia had been launched they had about 45 minutes to live they are desperately trying to figure out if there's a way to stop it or place for people to get get the safety or a way to let people know that they need to take shelter and it's an exercise in futility the bombs start falling in everybody dies nice huh nuclear Holocaust and then Hunter probably won some of you have probably in it some point yeah okay well as we move a little bit more toward the current we move into the era of consumerism going to a whole new level the internet the advance of the internet was actually initially called artnet and artnett still exists aren't that was a computer lash up between the US government and defense contractors and some major universities that had defense research grants to develop new technology and stuff and they needed effective ways to talk to each other so our net became the basis of that well the people in the University said wow this is great man we could use something like this in the civilian world too we should be letting linking up University's and so they start doing that and that lash up is ultimately what will become the internet the internet quotes on a sea of units Unix is the operating system of the internet still is today if you look at the internet code on the big servers it's still units that's still the the protocols that they're using and ultimately it started with that will get taken up to a new level in 1995 and in 95 the internet as you know it today was born and the reason Microsoft came out with Windows 95 and with it came the World Wide Web the web was then established and from that point on you start getting websites everybody wanted to make their own website it was kind of fun I had a you know real basic one but everybody started learning HTML and learning how to put Graphics up and it was It was kind of fun it's a lot more sophisticated now but this was the start of it meanwhile in 1985 Apple had had enough of Steve Jobs and they fired him and then Apple just kind of went like this and they were getting ready to hit the bottom meanwhile Steve Jobs what does he do he starts a new computer company called next where he puts out a 32-bit computer Graphics that had not been seen before and an operating system that would run it very efficiently that was an incredible Leap Forward well eventually apple is going to say hey Steve come back but there was something else he did when he built those computers he also created a new company in Hollywood it would take computers and generate animation with them rather than doing it by hand the old Disney way it became known as Pixar he established Pixar and eventually he will sell it to Disney for $9 billion dollars and then he goes back to work for Apple when he goes to work for apple he says okay you want me back you have to buy my operating system from next because I intend to use it for the next generation of apples and they said deal that operating system that he wrote with next that he brought in was ox10 you know OS X for those of you who are in the Mac world that was what the operating system was it came out of that that was the one he built for next and it has been one of the most successful Apple operating systems in history Apple had a big Resurgence first he brought out these IMAX so the Macintosh took up to a new level then he started putting out laptops how many of you have a MacBook but this this is the one that really saved Apple bacon this is the one that brought them back up to the Forefront the iPod not only could you put individual songs on there however you want it you can put 5,000 songs on there you weren't limited it would play them all how many of you have an iPod today yeah they stop selling them in like 2017-2018 somewhere in there but people still have them and they still use them although these work like iPods too now and that was by Design the next evolution the iPhone we have Steve Jobs to thank for these whether you have an Apple iPhone or some other smartphone that was the Legacy and what has that meant for Consumer America this is the most powerful consumer technology that has ever been made you can reach out and buy whatever you want with this you can you want to buy a car you can do it you want to buy anything log on to Amazon try to find something they don't carry if you can't find it there Google it you can find somebody selling it consumerism has never been more personal more on demand than it is right here anywhere you go you have a mall in your pocket or your purse or wherever you carry this thing it is an incredibly powerful tool buy stuff how many of you have used your phone to buy something in the last week me too Jason point this is modern consumers I've seen it go from the pre-internet world to embracing the internet to social media Facebook which I have an account specifically so that I don't have to use it I wanted to reserve it for myself and say no no if anybody trying to put up a fake account I'd say no this is my account they don't have it that's why I do it and I don't use it stay away from Facebook okay so that takes us up basically to the present you should have everything you need for the exam we will not meet next week this is our last meeting session so use next week have fun studying and preparing for whatever you have to and the final exam date is in the syllabus you will have all day and I'll probably send you out a reminder email as well okay I hope you had a great time I'll see you maybe next year
