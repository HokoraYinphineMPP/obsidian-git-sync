last: planting class is interested in social class where more slaves you own = higher you are

plantation master
whole thing is paternalist which means its like the "town fathers" or "founding fathers"

ideal plantation master should be the master and expert of the crops, family, and slaves.
(truely, the slaves know the most about the crops though)
(truely, the mistress know more about the family though)
mistress most of the time handles the family work (tends to keep master updated sometimes)

masters still act like theyre the one who knows it all
master is the father figure and provides for the slaves. even gives their lives meaning by giving work.
in reality: master whips and brutally beats slaves and tries to get as much profit as he can.

somehow they're still surprised when slaves want to rebel against them.

most marriages are arranged to marry elites only.
arranged marriage is now the standard.

the mistress deals with slave first aid. also their job to make clothes for the slaves. their biggest job is to keep an eye on the kitchen. they need to watch out for poison. 

antimiscegenation - no relationship allowed between races

no relationship between black man and white women, however while man and black women are fine.
they claim it's for a reason: gotta breed more slaves.




time effencicy was quite a buzz word.

most peoples education goes up to modern day 8th grade.
