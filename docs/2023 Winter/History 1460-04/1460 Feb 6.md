last: planting class is interested in social class where more slaves you own = higher you are

plantation master
whole thing is paternalist which means its like the "town fathers" or "founding fathers"

ideal plantation master should be the master and expert of the crops, family, and slaves.
(truely, the slaves know the most about the crops though)
(truely, the mistress know more about the family though)
mistress most of the time handles the family work (tends to keep master updated sometimes)

masters still act like theyre the one who knows it all
master is the father figure and provides for the slaves. even gives their lives meaning by giving work.
in reality: master whips and brutally beats slaves and tries to get as much profit as he can.

somehow they're still surprised when slaves want to rebel against them.

most marriages are arranged to marry elites only.
arranged marriage is now the standard.

the mistress deals with slave first aid. also their job to make clothes for the slaves. their biggest job is to keep an eye on the kitchen. they need to watch out for poison. 

antimiscegenation - no relationship allowed between races

no relationship between black man and white women, however while man and black women are fine.
they claim it's for a reason: gotta breed more slaves.




time effencicy was quite a buzz word.

most peoples education goes up to modern day 8th grade.

## The black belt
![[Pasted image 20230206163739.png]]

the soil was pure black and super soft: perfect for cotton growing soil

## slaves combing cotton


by 1780s cotton price has fully dropped to the point where people started to believe its not worth it to have slaves. 
eli whitney is famous for creating the cotton gin (1793)

cotton gin removes the seeds from the cotton by combing it
it basically was the cause of the civil war.

to run it correctly: it takes 3 people.

suddenly people started putting all the slaves out into the field instead of picking seeds out from cotton. they grew their fields 3 or even 4 times bigger. slaves became valuable again. 

process:
cotton is picked, then weighed.

the slaves had a different envronment on the cotton plantations compared to tobacco.
because: the old plantations were "task orientated"
in the morning the master would give the slaves tasks on what to do that day.
the slave sets their own pace because its based on the task that needs to be done.

cotton plantations is gang orientated
slaves are taken to an area and processes the cotton.
their case is based on a driver to keep them working.

## slave driver
slave drivers were in change of other slaves. only very loyal slaves were selected for this.

a slave driver is what keeps the "gang" working
they drive the slave "gang" to work faster.
theyre chosen from birth from being lighter skinned.
they have their own bed and live in the masters house
their clothes are purchased.
they eat the same food as the master. (seperately)

slave driver is the top job for a slave.

house slaves are also treated better

domestic workers is the second highest rank

skilled workers is under

and finally field gangs are at the bottom (the mass)

Slave families were torn apart as they were sold from tobacco/corn plantations to cotton plantations since the price of slaves shot up due to the cotton gin.

syn·cre·tism
`/ˈsiNGkrəˌtiz(ə)m/`
*noun*
the amalgamation or attempted amalgamation of different religions, cultures, or schools of thought.
"interfaith dialogue can easily slip into syncretism"

the biggest slave revolt was lead by a slave preacher.
