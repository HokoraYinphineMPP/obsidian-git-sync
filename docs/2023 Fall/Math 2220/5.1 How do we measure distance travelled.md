# 5.1 How do we measure distance travelled?
A car moves along a straight road with increasing velocity.

|Time (sec)|Velocity (ft)|
|-|-|
|0|20|
|2|30|
|4|38|
|6|44|
|8|48|
|10|50|

$\text{Distance} = \text{rate} * \text{time}$
$D = (60\text{ mph})(2\text{ hours})=120\text{ miles}$
	For the first 2 seconds, we can underestimate the distance travelled using velocity at 0 seconds during 1st 2 seconds:
	$d=(20)(2)=40\text{ ft}$
	during next 2 seconds (from 2 to 4 seconds)
	$d=(30)(2)=60\text{ ft}$

Underestimate for distrance travelled:
$(20)(2)+(30)(2)+(38)(2)+(44)(2)+(48)(2)\st{+(50)(2)}$
$=40+60+76+88+96$
$=360\text{ ft}$
Overestimate:
