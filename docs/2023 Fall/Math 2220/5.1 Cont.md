For an increasing or decreasing function, the difference between the upper and lower estimate is given by f(b)-f(a)*delta*T


###### Ex 

suppose $v(t)=\sqrt{4-t^2}$ on $[0,2]$, $t$ in seconds, $v(t)$ in ft/sec. We want to use upper and lower estimates to estimate the total distance traveled from $t=0$ to $t=2$

How small should $\Delta t$ be so the difference between upper and lower estimates is 0.01?

$(v(2)-v(0))*\Delta t=0.01$
$(0-2)*\Delta t=0.01$
$2\Delta t=0.01$
$\Delta t=0.005$

How many rectangles n should we use?
$\Delta t=\frac{b-a}{n}$
$0.005=\frac{2}{n}$
$n=\frac{2}{0.005}$
$n=400$

###### Ex 26
A particle moves with velocity $v(t)=3-t$ along x-axis with time $t$ in seconds, $v(t)$ in cm/s for $0\le t\le 4$.

a) use $\Delta t=1$ to give lower and upper estimates for the total displacement of the particle. What is the average of those estimates?

`Hokora's work:` 
Lower

|$3-t$|?|
|-|-|
|$3-0$|$3$|
|$3-1$|$2$|
|$3-2$|$1$|
|$3-3$|$0$|

$3+2+1+0=6$

Upper

|$3-t$|?|
|-|-|
|$3-1$|$2$|
|$3-2$|$1$|
|$3-3$|$0$|
|$3-4$|$-1$|

$2+1+0+(-1)=2$

$\frac{(6+2)}{2}=\fbox{4}$

b) graph $v(t)$. Give total displacement.

Total displacement: $|3-(-1)|=\fbox{4}$

# 5.2 The Definite Integral

divide $[a,b]$ into $n$ equal pieces.
$v=f(t)$ is velocity function

Want to find change in position of particle from $t=a$ to $t=b$.
$$\Delta t=\frac{b-a}{n}$$
Left hand sum for change in position
######Left Hand Riemann Sum
$$f(t_0)\Delta t+f(t_1)\Delta t + \dots f(t_{n-1})\Delta t+f(t_{n-1})\Delta t = \sum^{n-1}_{i=0}{\Delta t}$$

Def: suppose $f(t)$ is continuous for $a\le t\le b$. The **Definite integral** of $f$ from $a$ to $b$, written 
$$\int^{b}_{a}{f(t)dt}$$
is the limit of the left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums with $n$ subdivisions of $[a,b]$ as $n$ gets arbitrarily large (aka $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$).



### Left-hand Riemann sum
## $$\int^{b}_{a}{f(t)dt}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}{f(t_i)\Delta t}$$

### Right-hand Riemann sum
## $$\int^{b}_{a}{f(t)dt}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum^{n}_{i=1}{f(t_i)\Delta t}$$
$f$ is call the **integrand** and $a$ and $b$ called the bounds of integration.



###Riemann sums approximate area:
When $f(x)\le 0$ and $a<b$
Area under graph of $f$ and above x-axis between $a$ and $b$ is: $\int_{a}^{b}{f(t)dt}$

When $f(x)$ is positive for some x-values and negative for others, and $a<b$: $\int_{a}^{b}{f(t)dt}$ is the sum of areas above x-axis, minus areas below x-axis.
###### Ex
$y=sin(x^2)$
$\int^{\sqrt{2\pi}}_{0}{\sin{(x^2)}dx}$


###### Ex 57
a) Draw rectangles that give left-sum approximation of $\int_{0}^{\pi}{\sin{(x)}dx}$ with $n=2$ ($n$ is number of rectangles)



b) Do the same, but for $\int_{0}^{-\pi}{\sin{(x)}dx}$



c) From (a) and (b), what is the value of the left-hand sum approximation to $\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}{\sin{(x)}dx}$ with $n=4$?



General Riemann sum for $f$ on $[a,b]$ is sum of form $\sum_{i=1}^{n}{f(c_i)\Delta t_i}$

Where $a=t_0<t_1<t_2<\dots <t_n=b$
for $i=1,2,\dots ,n$
$\Delta t_i=t_i-t_{i-1}$
and $t_{i-1}<=c_i<=t_i$
$\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\text{value of }f(t)\text{ }}}$
