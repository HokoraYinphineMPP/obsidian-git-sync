# Chapter 5: Classes
## CSE 2010: Week 6
### What this lecture will cover...

- So far, we have been using C++ as a procedural language, meaning we have a program that has a bunch of different statements (lines of code) that do something in a specific order.
- This week we will look at how we can use C++ as an object-oriented **language**.
- This lecture will discuss the following:
	- Classes in C++
	- Designing, implementing, and using classes.


### Background: Types and Instances
In real life, a type is a concept from which an instance is created.
For example, the word circle is a type. We can have different instances of circles, some with different radii.


### Background: Attributes and Behaviors
- Any instance of a type that we encounter has a set of attributes and a set of behaviors.
- **Attributes:**
	- An attribute is a characteristic ascribed to an instance.
	- Examples:
|Instance Type|Attributes|
|-|-|
|*circle*|radius, perimeter, area|
|*employee*|name, address, position, salary|
|*student*|name, year, gpa, grades|
- **Behaviors:**
	- A behavior is an operation that an instance can perform on itself.
	- For example, if an instance is an employee, we assume they can give their name, give their address, give their position, etc.


### Classes and Objects in Programs
In object oriented programming, we still use terms like _type_ and _instances._

###### **Definitions:**

- **Class:** A USER DEFINED data type that represents a general concept or idea.
- **Object:** An instance of a class.
In programming, attributes and behaviors of an object are represented by
- Data members: A variable whose value represents an attribute or characteristic of an object.
- Member functions: A function that simulates one of the behaviors of an object.


### Using Classes in C++
- Steps to using classes in C++
	1. **Design** the class.
	2. **Define** a class by providing the **class name** , **declaring** its data members, and **declaring** its member functions.
	3. **Define** the class member functions.
    4. Use the class by **instantiating/declaring** objects of that class type and applying member functions on those objects.
For this course, we will show you how to separate your files when using classes.
1. Interface file: will have the class definition (class.h)
2. Implementation file: will have the class member function definitions (class.cpp)
3. Application file: Will have the program that uses the class (.cpp file where your main() function will be).


### Step 1: Designing a class

When you are designing a class, think about the following:


- What idea or concept do you want to represent? `(class name)`
	- Circle
	- Person
	- Car

- What “attributes” or “characteristics” do you need to properly represent this type? `(class data members)`
	- Circle
		- Radius
	- Person
		- Name
		- Age
		- Salary
		- Job
	- Car
		- Make
		- Model
		- Color
		- Year

- What “behavior” do you want instances of these types to do? `(class member functions)`
	- Access its attributes
	- Change its attributes

### Step 1.2: Deciding on Class Accessibility
Access modifiers determine how a class can be accessed from within or from outside of the class.
`Going to stick with these for now`
- *Public*:
	- Available to anyone outside/within the class
- *Private*:
	- Available only within the class
- Protected:
	- Available only within the class and in derived classes (will learn more about this in Chapter 8).

Some rules of thumb:

● Make all of your class data members private. You do not want their values to be erroneously


accessed or changed.
○ This is the main idea behind encapsulation.

● Your class will have public “setter” and “getter” functions to access/change their private data

members.


● Make member functions private only if you don’t want the outside world to access them.
○ They can still be called from fellow class functions.



## Step 2: Defining the Class

- Class definitions are stored in a header file, typically named the same as the class: className.h
- Within that file you have the following:

##### //any include statements of other libraries or classes your class might need

##### #ifndef CLASSNAME_H

##### #define CLASSNAME_H

class ClassName

##### {

##### public:

##### Default Constructor

```
Overload Constructor
Destructor
```
##### Other member functions (setters, getters, etc)

##### private:

```
data members
```
##### member functions you want to be private

##### };

##### #endif

```
● These are pre-processor directives, aka header guards.
● Used so that the compiler doesn’t get confused about
multiple class definitions with the same name.
```

## Step 2: Defining the Class

- Class definitions are stored in a header file, typically named the same as the class: className.h
    - Within that file you have the following:

##### //any include statements of other libraries or classes your class might need

##### #ifndef CLASSNAME_H

##### #define CLASSNAME_H

class ClassName

##### {

##### public:

##### Default Constructor

```
Overload Constructor
Destructor
```
##### Other member functions (setters, getters, etc)

##### private:

```
data members
```
##### member functions you want to be private

##### };

##### #endif

- The “public” section contains member functions, constructors, and
destructors that outside functions have access to.
    ● Constructors:
       ○ A member function that creates an object when it is called and initializes
          the data members of an object.
       ○ Constructors have the same name as your class.
       ○ Default constructors have no parameters and they initialize data
          members to default values.
       ○ Overload constructors use given parameter values to initialize data
          members.
    ● Destructors:
       ○ A destructor is automatically called and executed by the system when
          the object instantiated goes out of scope.
       ○ The name of the destructor is the same as the class but has a (~) before
          it.
    ● Member Functions:
       ○ Class member functions that have direct access to data members and
          other member functions.
       ○ Setters/Mutator functions are functions that modify an object’s
          attributes aka change the state of an object.
       ○ Getters/Accessor functions simply “access” the data of an object, but
          do not modify it at all.
- Use the const keyword when defining accessor functions.


## Step 2: Defining the Class

- Class definitions are stored in a header file, typically named the same as the class: className.h
    - Within that file you have the following:

##### //any include statements of other libraries or classes your class might need

##### #ifndef CLASSNAME_H

##### #define CLASSNAME_H

class ClassName

##### {

##### public:

##### Default Constructor

```
Overload Constructor
Destructor
```
##### Other member functions (setters, getters, etc)

##### private:

```
data members
```
##### member functions you want to be private

##### };

##### #endif

```
● The “private” section is where you place all data members
or private functions that will make up our class.
● Only class member functions have access to these data
members and private functions, meaning outside
functions cannot directly access them without using a
member function.
```

Example of a Circle class Definition.

Stored in “Circle.h”


### Step 3: Defining Class Member Functions

###### ● Ok, so we have our class defined, but now we need to actually write the code for

###### the member functions.

###### ● At the top of the implementation file, you MUST have the following:

**○ #include “className.h”**

###### ● Then define all the functions using the following format:

**○ return_type className::functionName()**

**{**

**}**

###### ● Define every single function, constructor, and destructor that you’ve declared.

###### ● All class member functions have direct access to the private data members, so

###### this means that they can use parameter values, data members, and any new

###### variables they declare in order to complete their task.


#### Example of Circle class

#### member function

#### definitions

Defining the constructors and

destructors.

Note that constructors have the

special ability of using an

initialization list to define data

member values.


#### Example of Circle class

#### member function

#### definitions

Defining the rest of the functions


### Step 4: Using your class by declaring OBJECTS

● Once you have defined your class and all of its member functions, you can

finally use your class!

● Use a class by declaring objects.

● Need: #include “className.h”

● To declare a new object, can use either default or overload constructor:

className objectName; //will use default constructor

className objectName(arguments); //will use overload constructor

Once you’ve declared an object, you can use it to invoke/call member functions

objectName.functionName(arguments);


#### Example program that

#### uses the Circle class

Let’s run it to see what it displays


## Compiling all of our separate files

- At this point we have the following 3 files:
    - Circle.h //definition of Circle class
    - Circle.cpp //member function definitions
    - Circle_main.cpp //program that uses Circle class
- We can compile all files together using a makefile
- In the makefile, we list all of our target
files/executables, and the commands we would use
to create them.
- Steps to create a makefile for the Person class:
1. vi makefile
2. Type every pair of lines that has the following
format:

target: source(s)

<tab char> rule/command

3. Now to compile and link the program, simply
    type

make
