# Hey!
If you're seeing this, I likely shared this link to you for my notes. I will warn you **these markdown files are formatted for the program i use**: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)! So don't come crying to me if you don't understand why the notes are janky as fuck.

If you need help on figuring out how to set it up, go ahead and message me on [Discord](https://discord.com/) [![Try signing up for Discord!](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/803186540359450664/1020532660008910919/discord.png)](https://discord.com/ "Try signing up for Discord!")
