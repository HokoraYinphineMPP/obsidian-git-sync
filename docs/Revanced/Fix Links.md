This fix is entirely done within your own Android settings!
I don't know how it's like for older versions of Android so DM me on Discord if you see any issues! `Hokora Yinphine MPP#6969`

go to Settings > Apps & notification > See all apps > Youtube > Advanced > Open by default > Open supported links > Don't allow app to open links
then Settings > Apps & notification > See all apps > Youtube ReVanced > Advanced > Open by default > Open supported links > Allow app to open supported links
