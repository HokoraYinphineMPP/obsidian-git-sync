# I have iOS!
Sadly iOS doesn't have ReVanced support yet...

So for now, you can keep in touch on the [ReVanced GitHub](https://github.com/ReVanced), [ReVanced Twitter](https://twitter.com/ReVancedapp), or the [ReVanced Discord](http://ReVanced.app/discord)!

Alternatively, you can also install
## YouTube++

# I use a browser!
There are many browsers out there with adblock like <a href="https://brave.com/download/">Brave</a>, <a href="https://browser.kagi.com">Orion</a>, <a href="https://www.opera.com/gx">Opera GX</a>, etc! If you want to stick with your own browser, you may be able to find chromium extensions such as <a href="https://ublockorigin.com">UBlock Origin</a> or <a href="https://www.adblockplus.org/en/download">AdblockPlus</a>!

These HMDs actually run Android! However, you likely may have to patch on a different device such as your phone or computer.
