Sadly iOS doesn't have ReVanced support yet...

So for now, you can keep in touch on the [ReVanced GitHub](https://github.com/ReVanced), [ReVanced Twitter](https://twitter.com/ReVancedapp), or the [ReVanced Discord](http://ReVanced.app/discord)!

Alternatively, you can also install

These HMDs actually run Android! However, you likely may have to patch on a different device such as your phone or computer.
