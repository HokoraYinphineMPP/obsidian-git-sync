Cool! Here's where things get fun.

## Install and open your Revanced Manager!
It should look something like this.

## Tap on "Recommended"

<details><summary>Wait! I see a feature I don't want!</summary>That's alright! However if you don't know what a patch exactly does, don't disable it! You'll likely break it.<br>
It's also worth noting that some patches are also togglable within the ReVanced Youtube app even after patching+installation as well! The toggles are tucked away in the youtube settings page at the bottom.<br>
If you're curious what exactly a patch does, say hi and send a question in the <a href="https://discord.gg/revanced">ReVanced Discord</a>!
</details>

## Finally Click "Done" and then "Patch"!

## It will take a while! So be patient!
