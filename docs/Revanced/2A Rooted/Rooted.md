## Install and open your ReVanced Manager!
It should look something like this.

## Tap on "Select an application"

## Then Tap on "Storage"

## Make sure the Current version matches the Recommended version!

## Tap on "Select patches"
![[scrcpy_YlvoTfHJ1b.gif]]
## Tap on "Recommended"
![[scrcpy_P90tIY8jcR.gif]]

<details><summary>It doesn't say Recommended, it says Default!</summary>That's alright! Tap that instead.<br> <br>
You're using a newer version of the Vanced Manager!
</details>

<details><summary>Wait! I see a feature I don't want!</summary>That's alright! However if you don't know what a patch exactly does, don't disable it! You'll likely break it.<br> <br>
It's also worth noting that some patches are also togglable within the ReVanced YouTube app even after patching + installation as well! The toggles are tucked away in the YouTube settings page at the bottom.<br> <br>
If you're curious what exactly a patch does, say hi and send a question in the <a href="https://discord.gg/ReVanced">ReVanced Discord</a>!
</details>

## Finally Click "Done" and then "Patch"!

## It will take a while! So be patient!
