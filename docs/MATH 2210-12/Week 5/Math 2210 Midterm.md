### For numbers 1 â€“ 4, find the derivatives of the following functions using the ***Limit Process.***

Note: Limit Process: $$f'(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$

#### **1.** $$f(x)=\frac{2}{x-2}$$
$$f(x)=\frac{2}{x-2}\Rightarrow f(x+h)=\frac{2}{(x+h)-2}\Rightarrow f'(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{(\frac{2}{(x+h)-2})-(\frac{2}{x-2})}{h}\Downarrow$$
$$f'(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{}{$$


#### **2.** $$f(x)=\sqrt{x-5}$$
#### **3.** $$f(x)=3\cos{x}$$
#### **4.** $$f(x)=\frac{x^3-8}{x-2}\textrm{, }x\ne2$$
#### **5.** In your own words, explain your understanding of the derivative of a function. Such as:
##### (a) Is the derivative of a function of x also a function of x?

##### (b) If it is, what type of function is it to the original function?

##### (c) The derivative function can also be used to determine what?
