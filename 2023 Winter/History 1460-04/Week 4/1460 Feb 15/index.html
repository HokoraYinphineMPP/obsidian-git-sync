<p>What's going on economically in the country yet the 1830s or so the West the Midwest the places where farmers were located those areas tended to Ally themselves politically with the southerners and the reason wasn't because they supported slavery but because the South they had a common cause also most of the exports from the Midwest when they ship things overseas they sailed things down the Mississippi River and they went out through the port of New Orleans okay so that meant that they had a close connection with the South and they had economic ties to the South however as the 1840s progress something else is going on railroads railroads are expanding and they're moving into that Midwestern area and people figure out hey the railroads are far faster and more effective for me to get my props to Market and so instead of going out of the Southern Port of New Orleans which is it the base of the Mississippi River as it leaves into development Mexico and as a result of that the political Alliance of the Midwest start shifting away from the south and toward the North and there's a lot of people in the midwest we're saying I opposed slavery but I oppose it simply because I don't want to hear it's not that they are morally objecting to slavery and they're not advocating for slavery to be Outlaw to the contrast they just don't want slavery in their state it's a way to keep slavery out and it's not the slavery they object to it's the people they don't want African Americans in their state they said the reason why the south is having so many problems is because they're too mixed so these people are called free soilers they're people who are against slavery in their area and they don't want that slavery pushed on them meanwhile the south is feeling more and more cornered as the West starts allying with the Northeast on their views on slavery when we talk about political power Congress is split into two houses House of Representatives and the Senate right how's the representative how do you determine who gets in what's it based on how do you determine how many representatives you get what's a based on population size okay the North or the South which one has the higher population and the slaves don't count the North all those immigrants who are coming in the people from Ireland the people from other places are all coming in looking for jobs are there jobs in the south no the slaves are in the workforce Academy they don't need immigrant labor the immigrants are getting drawn to the factories which are up north the industrial North is expanding rapidly and they are getting wealthier and wealthier as they go but more than that they're getting a huge population they are growing by Leaps and Bounds over the South the South knows that in the politics of Washington DC they have absolutely no hope of winning any kind of Southern vote in the House of Representatives which means that they need to stop some kind of unpopular legislation if they need to block it where does that have to happen if it can't happen in the house where does it happen there we go The Senate came in a whole lot faster than anybody expected it to when they may be Louisiana Purchase back in the early 1800s under Thomas Jefferson  they had to come up with a rule for whether people came in with their new States out of the Louisiana Territory that they had just acquired whether they would come in as a for your slave state and so what they did is they had decide that when the first one actually entered that was Missouri 1820 they said okay Missouri's here and they want to be a slave state so fine they're a slave state and everything south of the Southern border of Missouri is a slave state when it comes into the union and everything north of that will be a free state that was the agreement they made it was called the Missouri Compromise by the 1850s the problem here is now you're getting territories outside of the  Louisiana Territory coming in and the big one that they expected to be a slave state ends up being a free state California Southerners genuinely thought it was going to be a slave state but it wasn't and then they take a look at the rest of the Louisiana Territory and realize everything below that line that they drew has already entered the Union all the slave states that can come from Louisiana Territory have come from the Louisiana Territory but there is still plenty of unoccupied or unincorporated territories that have not yet become States north of that one what's that mean for the South balance in the Senate that they've been maintaining for a long time is suddenly in Jeopardy and if that happens they will be completely at the mercy of the northern voters and if the northern voters go to the extreme of wanting to outlaw slavery there would be nothing the South can do to stop it if that balance gets disrupted so the southerners are feeling like they were pushed back into a corner they can't rely on the west remember the Midwest I said they were politically alive early on but now they're becoming more and more allied with the North so they're becoming a little bit more worried a little more desperate now meanwhile there's a fringe party risen the Republican party and it originally was made by people that were viewed within dominant Americans society as extremists they included people like abolitionists people who were willing to sacrifice themselves even die for the cause of abolition most people thought abolitionists were a little wacky okay they thought they were people way over on the extreme and when his new party starts up the Republican Party nobody gives it a second thought they're not they don't take it seriously the Democratic party has a firm hold on America and the Democratic party is one that support slavery enter the Kansas and Nebraska territories the Kansas and Nebraska territories are within the Louisiana Purchase in Kansas is ready to apply for Statehood and the South now sees their balance going away they know that 90% of the people in Kansas oppose labor they know this this is no secret they know that when Kansas comes in they're going to choose to come in as a free state if you give them the choice nonetheless why don't we leave it up to the people in in all of these territories and understand what they're doing they're getting rid of the Missouri Compromise they're throwing that out and saying when new States come in from that territory and for the rest of the territory out here we let them choose whether they want to be a free state university it's called popular sovereignty so the Missouri Compromise gets thrown out and popular sovereignty comes in the Compromise of 1850 they know Kansas will choose to be a free state but they're hoping that others will choose to be a slave state instead and that's the hope that they're dangling for the southerners meanwhile the South does does not believe for one instant that any any territory up there will come in as a slave state reason being they're all free sweaters they're people who don't want slavery in their territory because they don't want slaves in their territory it's not that they're objecting to the institution they're objecting to it in their backyard so they will choose freedom so essentially Kansas will be a referendum on slavery that's how the South sees it that if they choose to come in as a free state slavery is now in Jeopardy and the North and run roughshod over all Southern interests they've been able to keep the balance for a while but now it's in danger and so things start getting heated as Kansas is getting ready to choose in their election between whether they're going to be a slave statement free state there's violence there's harassment there's all sorts of tactics keep free state voters away from the polls But ultimately what happens is a whole huge number of people from Missouri come flooding over the border into Kansas to vote in their election when they finally did Tally's later they found that 2/3 of the votes that were cast were fraudulent 65% of them yikes that is by far the most corrupt election in American history that is voter fraud on an epic scale and when that happens all hell breaks loose Kansas turns into a Battleground in response to this vote where all of a sudden people are saying oh yes the pro slavery group won the voting Kansas yeah sure they did they said all those people from Missouri you came in and voted they did it so that they can force slavery honest Ram it down our throat now keep in mind with the Republican party is safe the South will ultimately try to force slavery on the rest of the country by any means necessary now most people are saying oh yeah that's that's hogwash but the Republicans are saying No this is slave power they are pushing slave power you watch they're going to do this and everybody's discounting the Republicans they're out on the out on the edge and and they're just extremists well Kansas changes a lot of people's opinions all of a sudden this massive voter fraud on an epic scale starts getting people to say were the Republicans right?  Are they trying to impose slave Park cuz this sure looks like they're trying to subvert the will of the voters and force slavery on Kansas and then violence breaks out in cans Kansas has its own little Civil War one night a man named John Brown who is an abolitionist staunch opponent to slavery and he hears about all the voter fraud that went on in Kansas and he is in Kansas he hates it he rises up one night with his sons and they all take up broadswords you know like knights from the Middle Ages and they invade three different families homes and all three of them were pro-slavery people and they kill them all with the swords and that starts a wave of violence in both directions the South will form a drunken Army and they actually get their hands on two cannons they invade Lawrence Kansas and they expect to find people there but people tipped off Lawrence Kansas hey this big mob of people is coming so they find the town is deserted basically but the violence will continue to escalate back in Washington news gets back to the Senators and Congressman of what's going on and one of the most outspoken Advocates of getting rid of slavery one of the biggest components of slavery is Senator Charles Sumner and Senator Sumner delivers a scathing speech in front of a joint house and the Senate are present for this and the speech was entitled the crime against Kansas Picture of everything that happened he puts the blame fully on the senior senator from the state of South Carolina Senator Andrew Butler saying he's the reason they're doing this the sovereignty of. he's encouraging this kind of illegal Behavior he in. And Senator Senator Butler wasn't present to rebut this howeverhis brother-in-law a congressman from South Carolina Preston Brooks was and after after Summoners done with his speech he's pulling together all of his notes at the lectern and Preston Brooks walks down to the floor of the room where all the speeches were being given and proceeds to beat Senator Sumner unconscious with his walking stick  on the senate floor the first time it's ever happened people start going you know what maybe the Republicans got the right view of this and maybe I'm wrong  maybe I should listen to him a bit more and then the Supreme Court got into the action the Dred Scott case was heard Scotty Sanford you guys know about the Dred Scott face  sort of okay drink Scott was a slave who had been taken with his master to visit friends up north in Minnesota and then they returned back to the South and Dred Scott filed charges saying I should have gotten freed when I crossed over into free territory now the laws of America were very clear that when you crossed the line North you don't automatically game you're free there were slave runaways who were being caught and returned to their owners below that line so the fugitive slave laws alone would have been enough to debunk this that's all the more that should have happened in this court case instead chief justice Rodger Taney who is a southerner wants to give judicial protection for slavery and he oversteps and he oversteps in a big way and in the process he writes what is arguably the worst Supreme Court decision ever in his history certainly the top three and that is he says that not only is he a Slave but all the laws in the north that that outlaw slavery or unconstitutional because the Constitution says slavery is legal which it doesn't and he uses a lot of questionable rationale but basically says Congress does not possess the right to outlaw slavery or regulate it and limited in any territory in the United States in other words what was the Republicans are saying it's going on the south is trying to Ram slavery down everybody's throat here's Roger Taney trying to do exactly that so rather than take a more conciliatory approach and try to work out the deal in a calmer or sedate way the south is lashing out and they're doing it in very unethical ways  so after the dreads got decision comes down a lot of people in the north are saying you know I don't want to destroy the South and I don't want to outlaw slavery but this is going too far the Republicans got it right the south is trying to force slavery on everyone and I don't want slavery up here there's people who want slavery outlawed for their own beliefs that slavery is wrong but there's also people who want slavery limited just because they don't want to be inundated with them and then John Brown is heard from again John Brown and a number of followers take a trip out to Harpers Ferry Virginia where they overrun a federal Armory a federal Armory that's where the military keeps his weapons okay so he's trying to steal military grade weaponry and he wants to use those weapons to arm a slave rebellion problem is he tried to do it in Virginia remember what I said about how the upper South where the tobacco is being grown depleted their soil and they started to sell off most of their slaves to the Deep South there weren't enough slaves in Virginia to really do this convincingly and brown didn't really get that and so there he is holding Harpers Ferry taking control of it and he had nobody to give weapons too and was surrounded he was caught he and others were put on trial and he was executed in 59 now the southern response to this is oh well that guy was clearly a nut job in a criminal he was terrorists I mean he over he overran a federal Armory and tried to start a flavorful when Southerners have nightmares they see armed slaves killing them and sitting their throat when they shut their eyes worst nightmare and they see somebody who actually tried to make that nightmare come true so of course they're saying well clearly this guy was an insane Criminal it's a good thing they executed and across the North Church bells are ringing where churches are saying he was actually a martyr for the cause he laid down his life in the in pursuit of freeing the slaves because it was immoral they're going I can't believe they're actually not only condoning this guy but celebrating this guy was a criminal and they realized just how wide that division is now keep in mind this is only about a year and a half before the start of the Civil War so the tensions are really ramping up and then came the election of Abraham Lincoln was running on the Republican ticket this party had suddenly become a real player but the whole thing is the Democrats were still a big enough party to wear they had a 60% majority there's no way Lincoln could have won until the Democrats did something incredibly stupid the southern delegation came into the Democratic National convention we want to run on a platform of slave power nationalized Slave Code and the northern Democrats are saying we can't do that there's no way we get elected if we do that now why don't we just stick to popular sovereignty and take the moderate room and the southern delegation refuses and the northern delegation refuses to go along with the southerners and ultimately they form separate conventions  the southern delegation of Democrats won one candidate the northern delegation run another one and guess what they do they split the vote right down the middle  30% in the north 30% of the Sout. 40% for Lincoln Lincoln won with 40% of the national vote no president in history ever before or since has ever won with that little of the national book 40%, and the South suddenly was scared out of their winds oh my gosh we put a republican in the presidency he is going to use all sorts of presidential incentives to induce the western states that come in to be free states he's going to try to put in a system where slavery is outlawed maybe even a constitutional amendment that Outlaws and before Lincoln ever sets foot in office December of 1860 a month after the election matter of fact it was I remember right December 23rd just before Christmas day anyway it's right around that Christmas. Of time South Carolina secedes they pull out of the Union they don't even wait to see what Lincoln might do or what they might be able to achieve under Lincoln they don't take the chance they just break off right there and a couple others will follow him others are more hesitant they want to see what happens and ultimately it will slide into a Civil War by April 61 Laura's butt Northwinds the south is now a defeated enemy okay when the north winds keep in mind that the South pulled out of the United States but when they lose the idea is they are going to be brought in gradually but they're not in control of the government until they come back in which means the north controls Congress both houses and they control the presidency as long as Lincoln is in Lincoln gets shot and a Democrat will actually become president Johnson but and they will start imposing their will on the south the first is the 13th Amendment 13th Amendment is very simple slavery is illegal it is a ban on slavery in the United States so 13th Amendment officially wipes out slavery when that happens the southern states will start passing local laws that start putting restrictions on the recently freed blacks by saying well let's come up with a series of laws that essentially keep them in a state of forced labor without calling its labor so it was de facto slavery and in order to counter that Congress starts passing laws that the South just ignores at which point another Constitutional Amendment will be passed one that horses the state laws to abide by the national law essentially saying National laws higher than the state laws and they have to agree or the state laws are overturned there was this concept of States had individual sovereignty over their local laws and if the conflict came between the national law and the local law on a local issue local law was the one that went they went with and essentially the 14th Amendment will change that keep in mind people of all the amendments ever put into the Constitution the 14th is quite possibly the most significant and the reason is because it forces all the rest of those laws that the government will pass at the federal level to apply to the state so every time you see a constitutional challenge of a law a state law that never would have happened before the 14th Amendment after the 14th Amendment so if they're ever challenging the constitutionality of a state law in the US or in the US Supreme Court well guess what the 14th Amendment will always be used as a rationale at least in part issue on Free Speech they'll cite the First Amendment and they'll say the 14th Amendment making the First Amendment apply to the state you see how much teeth that has suddenly the South no longer has the ability to do all this without violating federal law the one Saving Grace for the South the Supreme Court is dominated by Southerners keep that in mind then they go one more step as more and more restrictions try to get put on put in place on blacks in the South recently freed slaves they sink the nail in the car the 15th amendment gives black men the right to vote participate civically and run for office they can become congressman they can become Senators they can run for president if they want and they can vote voting is political power the 15th amendment was controversial in a lot of ways where the big controversy came was not actually in giving black men the right to vote they expected that something like this would be full but they thought that maybe it would be universal suffrage the the controversial thing was the exclusion of women white women had been pushing for quite a while hey why don't you give us the right to vote and then they hear the 15th Amendment is coming down and they think they have a shot at convincing people to include women in that and then they find that they're including black men but they're not including white women remember the great chain of being white women saw themselves above everyone of other races and now they feel like they've just been dropped down below them so this is a big blow to the white women leading the charge was Elizabeth Cady Stanton and she ultimately becomes the founder of the women's suffrageman she will be joined later by Susan B Anthony and together they will fight for over half a half of half a century I almost said half a decade and then I almost said half a millennium 50 years.  
Taking all of those Southern States and bringing them back into the United States piece by piece reconstructing the Union they want to bring everybody back in when the blacks come in for the vote for the first time. See black exercising the right to vote interesting thing take a look at the difference variety this was actually a well-constructed artistic piece by Thomas Nast the political cartoonist fairly poor he was a former slave probably a long time given gray hair Gray beard and he's voting behind him this guy's actually fairly well dressed isn't he </p>
<h2 id="blacks-voting-for-the-first-time-in-the-us">blacks voting for the first time in the US<a class="headerlink" href="#blacks-voting-for-the-first-time-in-the-us" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>so it's showing you that some free blacks are actually doing okay financially usually from the north and usually with their freedom papers before the war behind him a union veteran a soldier somebody who served during the Civil War on the side of the north and he's voted so this gives you a little bit of a cross-section as some of the people who are involved and the fact that it's not just all field hands voted there's a widespread of people okay and what the south is afraid of is coming to pass blacks are getting political power the only way to fight this is to keep them away from the poles so they start using intimidation and Terror attacks and to that end an organization forms on an X by an X Confederate kernel whose name was Nathan Bedford Florence and he organizes a bunch of local people most of them are veterans of the Confederacy and they were part of the losing side they didn't like losing and they don't like the future of what's coming the organization they form is a loose organization it's not well organized it's more or less people who want to Simply intimidate people from voting that's their job that's what they want to do they call themselves now here's another political cartoon by Thomas Nast </p>
<h2 id="1st-ku-klux-klan">1st Ku Klux Klan<a class="headerlink" href="#1st-ku-klux-klan" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>showing you what the clan is standing for okay over here on the left who is this guy okay he's an ex confederate soldier notice and he's shaking hands with the clan who has a big smile on his face the clan guy does because he's offering this guy hope he's offering him a direction for his feelings notice that this guy is part of an organization called the white League this was a group that formed after the Civil War of whites across the South were afraid that the white majority would be threatened and they wanted to ensure that whites would remain Superior in the South even after the fall of slavery the blacks would always be below that's what white supremacy means okay yes basically nothing the areas are more or less an extension of the same mindset okay so here you have a guy the white League was that white supremacist organization one of the earliest in the post Civil War. Now take a look at some of the things that are included in this I know that from where you are you may not be able to read all of this up here it says the Union as it was this is a white man's government the United States was made for whites the Lost Cause which was the Civil War the Confederacy they lost and they're they're demoralized they're bummed out their economy is destroyed their food supply is destroyed and now they're freeing the slaves so their society is being destroyed everything about their way of life is completely up in it they don't know what's going to happen next and now black people are voting. Danger warning worse than slavery what is it that they see is worse than slavery a black family man woman baby what are they doing I mean aside from powering in fear Theyre learning. remember one of the biggest dangers people were warned about is literacy don't let black be educated and they see blacks getting educated as being the future danger now keep in mind the clan has an idea that they will try to pass some kind of learning exam in order for people to have to be able to vote so keeping them illiterate means it keeps them out of the polls.  None other than war hero Ulysses S Grant for president. And Grant was largely responsible for the strategy that defeated the South that is he's going to deny the South access to any kind of real money. They can't buy weapons they can't buy support from Europe if they don't have money what is their source of money? Cotton. So he comes up with a very simple solution as he's ranging across the South with his army he torches every cotton field he finds. His underling who eventually replaces him when he becomes commander of the entirety of the Union Army is General Sherman and General Sherman not only takes this strategy he upset he takes a whole bunch of EX slaves and he puts them in Union uniforms sort of but they have no military training he calls him Contraband soldiers and essentially when he moves into a new southern town they torch the fields and then he turns the Contraband soldiers out and turns of loose on the homes and says GoNoodle what are they they're terrorizing those people but they don't just stop at destroying the cotton they're also destroying food fields.  So the south is dealing with food shortages Too Atlanta has food riots during the later days of the Civil War this is ugly and so people associate all of these things with Grant." this is the worst thing that Southerners could have happen other than freeing the slaves" putting Ulysses S Grant in charge of the country so the KKK is formed To try to defeat his election to keep blacks away from the polls Grant who is still leader of the army at this point sends in troops. Rounds up the clan now keep in mind the clan that you might Envision in your mind is not the first Clan there were three Clans total over history we are now dealing with the third planet they're the ones who are around today the first plan however was only a few hundred people maybe 350 at the most. Okay and they weren't really all that well organized rounds up the vast majority of them and holds them there until after the election results the black feels safer to go to the polls and then very few of them actually get charged with any crimes maybe 20 or 30 and the rest of them are simply let go. Grant was elected 500,000 African Americans voted in that presidential election Grant was elected by a mere 300,000 margin of votes.  Grant was elected by the freed slaves they made the difference. And he knew he needed to protect that. If you wanted to get reelected in another 4 years he would have to ensure that they stayed safe and protected. In the Reconstruction period, they moved into a. Called the Freedmen's Bureau. Where the Friedman's Bureau oversaw the protection of Rights of blacks in the south and it would help them with education it would help them in case people were hassling them terrorizing them whatever and backing them up our Union troops Union troops occupied the south after the Civil War they did not leave and so the troops are enforcing this protection the southerners really hate this but even more than that the north was sending down a bunch of people to oversee all of the operations going on in the Deep South okay and these people these officials coming down from the north were supposed to oversee not only protecting the rights of African Americans but also the funding efforts to rebuild the communities that had been destroyed to help people with tangible needs that they have food housing clothes Etc and the problem here is that a lot of those Northern officials were corrupt and they were pocketing a lot of the money and Grant didn't care he didn't do a thing about it those people became known as Carpetbaggers by the south feeling all the money that is meant to help the South and pocketing it for the for himself now are there officials coming down from the north who are legitimately honest absolutely. But are there enough corrupt ones to give this accusation round yes there's a lot of it. This is what the clan thinks about carpet backers *** image 2*** notice this guy is holding a suitcase with Ohio on the side it's telling you he's from the north and this is a carpet bag okay that's that's what they're calling it's a donkey okay with KKK on the side what is that tell you what's a donkey assemble up the KKK supports they are the political Defenders of Democrats  not Republican okay so this period Of reconstruction moves into the 1870s the war ended in 1865 and as you move into the 1870s America has a big economic downturn about 73 and when that happens Northerners who are getting really tired of the South resisting everything complaining about everything constantly bringing in issues of everything this wrong with reconstruction you're tired of it you're tired of fighting with them they're tired of all of this crap that's going on they just wanted to go away they say we have other problems to worry about the economy needs to be dealt with reconstructions getting to be a pain so Along Comes the 1875 when the South starts deliberately excluding blacks from their businesses they put limitations on what they can do what they start doing is separating the black community from the white community and making it so the black can't have any interaction with the whites the federal government says okay we got to pass some laws that limit the money so they pass the Civil Rights activity 75 it goes to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court which is largely dominated by seven strikes down almost all the provisions as being unconstitutional saying they violate the Commerce club that people who run businesses have a right to run the Business Without government interfere and the only thing that they say stands are any of the things connected specifically with electioneering basically politics they're allowed to vote they're allowed to run for office that's very clear about a 15th amendment so those Provisions stand but everything else get struck down suddenly people are saying does that mean that this is the new way? This separation of blacks and whites and so more of it starts happening it starts increasing in Pace there's a number of other cases that go back and forth but they're still dealing with that gray area what's the standard? Meanwhile the north is tired of dealing with the south on this whole issue and they just want reconstruction done with 1876 the presidential election there is a lot of voter fraud and the southern candidate wins as the Northerners start to get ready to screen bloody murder of the Southern leaders of the political party the Democrat leaders go let's talk come over here we'll see that there was a certain amount of unethical illegal election going on and we will stand behind you and say yes the northern candidate did in fact win but you got to do something for us. When that candidate gets into office reconstruction is over done. Pull the troops out of the South and let us get on with our lives at which point. The republicans were already done anyways.  Hayes takes office and the first thing he does is he says congratulations reconstruction is over we are one nation complete again the United States moves forward from this point on so, reconstruction's over and now all of those troops start pulling out of the South the Freedmen's Bureau goes away, and blacks across the South are kind of goin "uh oh" now do the abuses kick in readily any more than they already are? The truth is they didn't and the reason is because Southerners were so happy to see the troops go that they knew if they started really going after African Americans beating him down killing them whatever the troops would come right back in the Northerners would say no no you guys we didn't say you could do that and they'll come back in. Instead the expand on the idea of separating segregation becomes where they focus their attention and it gets some legal challenges all through the 1880s as we move into the 1890s until finally the Supreme Court comes down with a landmark decision Plessy vs Ferguson you guys heard of it some people are going now other people are not.  Separate but equal they've come up with a new standard for segregation separate but equal that is it is perfectly constitutional perfectly legal to have separate facilities so long as they're equal. now they get the seperate part very well, but not the equal part. the period That we are moving into the post-blessing period Becomes known as the Jim Crow. Segregation Jim Crow and segregation are interchangeable terms basically the Jim Crow. Starts deliberately creating segregation as policy and putting it into law all across the South segregation is going in segregation of Transportation a white car and a black car or they would call it a colored car  blacks had to buy food in the main dining room of a lot of restaurants they had to come around the back and order from the kitchen through the back door they could order food they just couldn't have it in the in the dining room is that separate but equal they don't have a dining room to eat it if they had their own dining room yeah maybe but as it is separate was never equal in fact even when they had equal facilities was it really equal you were trading somebody different lesser less appealing based on the color of their skin based on their race and that was inherent in segregation they're segregating because they don't want those people who are seen as less desirable by the people who are pushing these policies that's where segregation come from and it will last all the way until 1954 when the Supreme Court will take it down until then segregation will be the law of the South the Jim Crow. Immediately starts putting restrictions on voting. But they do it in a way that they say is is not directed at any race it's instead directed at all the people it doesn't exclude anybody based on race and this is the only way they got away with it.  A big popular way to limit black from the polls was literacy tests now the white literacy test red like a sea Spot Run book you know those back from your kindergarten or first grade those little learning pamphlets these Spot Run you know those things well that would be kind of what the white test look like the black test red like a PhD dissertation and if you got so much as one word wrong they say nope sorry you don't have the right to vote the Australian ballot became another way in Australia they had a problem with mob corruption where people would follow people into the voting booth and make sure that they voted the way they were supposed to vote either the way they were the only person who's allowed in the voting booth is the person voting that became known as the Australian ballot and so the US said or the southern states brother said well we're simply trying to prevent any time of voter manipulation by ensuring that those people have the right to vote is that really what they're doing no there's some blacks who don't have the reading skills or might miss some of the tricks that lights are using on the ballots and they'll end up voting for the wrong thing well that was another problem there was one ballot for blacks and one ballot for whites develop for whites was very clear-cut about it for blacks it was confusing it was designed to be to trick people into voting for the wrong thing and they didn't have somebody smart looking over their shoulders actually want to do see how that one's kind of Shifting down over here you want to vote for this one you don't have that protection with the Australian ballot gerrymander was another problem redrawing the district lines of where voters are let's say you have a white Community here and a black community next to it and the voting districts originally have this area as one voting district in this area as one voting district well that would mean that the black voting district would have a majority and they'd be able to get their people in in office so what they do is they redraw the lines and instead go this way and this way and say everybody in this group is in one voting district everybody in this group is in another one and in this one they ensure that there's like a 52-48% favor for whites and the same in the other one and so instead of having the blacks win one and the whites win one the whites win them both because they outnumber the blacks in each of those districts because of the way they drew the voting line. That also becomes the way of controlling and limiting black votes.  there are two leaders. On the left is Booker T Washington he is America's first PhD and he established the very first college that admitted blacks he wanted to create a university that was their specifically to educate last because they were being discriminated against in so many places and he set a good example for what recently freed African Americans and people in that post Civil War South shoot his fire to that is self-improvement through education that's what he was advocating </p>
<h2 id="booker-image">booker image<a class="headerlink" href="#booker-image" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>he is also a significant head he wasn't the first PhD like he was but he was a PhD and he was one of the early so they both have a very high commitment to education were they differ is on their approach to segregation Booker T Washington says don't worry about the segregation laws don't worry about any of that instead focus on what you can control self improvement worry about yourself and when enough people have really improved themselves in our college educated and well spoken Etc they will be able to get those laws changed down the road don't worry about it just deal with what you can focus on WEB Dubois however while he supported all of the educational aspirations he disagreed with Booker T Washington in this he says no too many people have fought and bled and died in order to put these freedoms in place and he's not going to stand by and let those be taken from us gradually piece by piece his big cause is voting rights this is what he's known for. defending black people. But these become two of the most prominent African American voices in how to deal with segregation put up with it for now focus on what you can fight it tooth and nail and especially defend the right but both of them say education good. get educated. Okay so that's something they have in common.  And keep in mind at the heart of it is this thing back to the great chain of being the issue of place keeping people in their place places them okay Southerners believe the plastic gotten out of their place so they are deliberately trying to keep them in their place with these segregation laws below whites and every time somebody rises above that they have a word for that "uppity". Somebody is rising too far up they call him uppity and they will do everything they can to hammer the nail down whether it's abuse terrorism lynching you name it that is typically how they respond to it self a number of the stereotypes crystallize in this reconstruction and post Reconstruction Era as we move into Jim Crow stereotypes view African Americans as unintelligent and even animalistic oftentimes you'll see political cartoon where blacks are portrayed with faces that look almost like monkeys they look very apee like whites believe it is their Duty to protect the South as well as the North from the ravaging and the excesses of the black community. You know a lot of that early Disney stuff was coming out in the 30s and 40s and segregation is still very much alive and well that was during the Jim Crow Era so yeah you do get some of that going into the Disney films another thing that they portrayed African Americans in general as having no impulse control they aren't able to control their urges if they want booze they start drinking and they can't stop until they're drunk and pass out if they want sex they can't stop themselves if they want somebody with sex especially black men they will go after them until they get them and what is it that every black man wants more than anything else in the world white women yes that becomes part of The Stereotype and all of those stereotypes are portrayed big screen on the first Epic full length motion picture ever made in history. The movie was an absolute Masterpiece in cinematography they pioneered all sorts of movie making techniques that are still used today it was brilliant it is also arguably the most racist movie ever made and it was called The Birth of a Nation none of you you have or pieces of it at least yeah it was 3 hours long it was epic no movie had ever even approached this DW Griffith was a southerner but he also wholeheartedly believe the stereotypes were real and basically this movie was about the rise of the Ku Klux Klan as Heroes not just Defenders of the Southern cause but Defenders of the misguided Northerners who misjudged the African Americans and were being victimized by them and they had to come to their aid too so this isn't a stubborn thing it's a white versus black thing it's not a regional thing it's a national thing and heroizes the clan in such a way that it inspires the researchers rise because of this movie when you think of the clan images of the clan like this Burning crosses white sheets pointy heads eye holes cut out that's the second Clan that's where this was done widespread the big armies of people well this is during World War 1 that Birth of a Nation came out 1915 by the end of the war there's black veterans returning home and they saw what life was over like in Europe they said "boy things are so much better for us over there". And all of a sudden you start seeing a string widespread a widespread occurrence of lynchings going on across the South where a lot of returning black veterans from World War 1 religion in their uniforms </p>

<p>also going on during this time is the social reform of the Progressive Era we'll talk about that when we get to the religious section 2 but a lot of Reform is going on at this point in time and one of the big reforms was anti-alcohol also  widespread immigration is coming in and a lot of people are becoming very very nativist in their mindset remember nativism anti-immigrant and then there's the Protestants they aren't just anti-alcohol they are anti-catholicand this is where the second plan is genius being Diversified they're not just saying it's about African Americans they're saying it's about America for Americans in other words they embrace the religious Protestant approach of wanting to fight the Catholic influence wanting to fight the Immigrant influence wanting to fight the black influence and keep America American there's a lot of people say well I don't really agree with their tape on African Americans but you know what they say about those Catholics? "mmmhmm".  And all of a sudden they get support from that group well I don't really care about the Catholics but boy I sure care about all those immigrants coming in "mmmhmm" and they draw support from that the plan diversifies they learn some lessons from this. Of time one of the big things that happens is the rise of the mega Corporation the trusts Rockefeller Carnegie people like this and they use that same organization for the clan to give them widespread organization Across the Nation and they also come up with interesting names which are kind of absurd in today's time for example the local leader of the local chapters of the KKK we're called kleagals. And you ever see one of those plan guys that's wearing the red outfit not the white outfits everybody else is wearing that guy's a grand wizard he's sort of like a regional area director like a regional vice president. Notice how it's mirroring the corporations and then you have the National High Grand wizard who organizes everything National. So they have structure they have memberships they have people who are in charge of things they do organizational activities both terrorist activities as well as Community Support activities to give them a positive view. A couple different cartoons that came off came out in this. Of time let's take a look at this one first of all the 18th Amendment</p>

Head of the Catholic Church okay the Roman Catholic church and this thing is coming down and putting its roots notice it's like a tree trunk that's putting Roots into the ground so it's saying it's trying to put its roots in our country we need to get rid of that with the ballot hands off this was a church publication </p>

<p>Anaheim did you guys know Anaheim was founded by the true story the head of the American Bar Association chapter for Orange County was a wizard for the KKK. And he was in charge of law in Orange County tells you exactly where they're legal mindset was going okay so you start yet absolutely yes it did and really the big chapters of the plan for Southern California went from Anaheim all the way out to South Bay basically Long Beach San Pedro Hawthorne that area that's where the clan was really heavily centered and So the plan is Diversified they take it on nativism they go anti Jew anti-Semitism becomes part of their language and Catholic and by 1926 the clan reaches it's all time highest membership of over six million people Nationwide from Birth of a Nation just 11 years earlier in 1926 6 million recruited</p>
