<p>First things first I had hoped not have to push the exam but we're going to have to push the exam okay and part of that is we're still running a hair behind but we've made up most of the ground the bad news is when I draw up my syllabus I actually put the exam a week sooner than I should have in the schedule anyway so basically it's a week and a half earlier than it should be right now and so I'm going to push it back one week and we should be on track also in order to make up the time for those of you doing the extra credit assignment normally I show the movie in class and instead of showing it in class I'll give you a streaming link so you can watch it on your own and there's a benefit to that too I mean yes you have to watch it on your own rather than in here but the good news is if you kind of tuned out something and you have to go back looking for something you said oh what did that say again you can readjust it okay you can go back and and watch it over again or you know look at certain parts so having the ability to you know do your paper and then go wait a minute what about that you can go find it again so that's an extra advantage okay so we all clear on that yep one week I'll push it back a week so instead of having the exam as soon as you get done with spring break which means you would have had to study over spring break you can study if you want or wait until like most of you will the night before yes or even the day of oh man let's pick up where we left off where we left off was basically the end of the progressive air the nail in the coffin and progressivism was really the passage of the two constitutional amendments in 1920 the 18th and the 19th the 18th amendment was again prohibition outlawing alcohol the 19th amendment was women's suffrage and things were a little bit out of control morally socially in a lot of ways and some people see this is the last ditch effort to try to control it but they passed these with reservation the truth is even people who spoke out against the evils of alcohol had a bottle stashed in the back of their cupboard anyway so they drank they just didn't drink heavily or didn't drink in public but they still wanted their boots and the moral reformers were going yes we accomplished something and people are going yeah but then we really which is a big reason why the year after prohibition is passed alcohol consumption went up not down okay the other ones women suffrage and a lot of men were going you know we did this because we felt we needed to in order to control the morals of America the right to vote I mean today yeah absolutely but at the time it was still very much a man's world and women operated within that political and social structure so having women have the right to vote a lot of men they passed it but they're looking back going if we really do that I can't believe we did that why did we do that so with those last two being if not completely unpopular at least questionable people are going okay maybe we've changed enough for now let's let's stop changing plus there's a backlash against the rapid change and this is something that all societies have whenever there's a period of Rapid change whether it's in a liberal direction or a conservative Direction in other words having liberal changes expanding certain ideas as opposed to a conservative slam the brakes on and let's regress okay whatever your liberal or conservative country might be whenever you have period of change you're going to get pushed back there's going to be resistance and the Progressive Era there was a lot of change all in a very short time keep in mind that most of the legislation was passed within 10 years and in that 10-year period from 1910 to 1920 huge amount of legislation is passed also in this time something else to keep in mind what happened between 1914 and 18 anyone and World War 1 has a huge impact on the Progressive Era as well when the veterans were returning they were screwed up and they were almost all drinking very heavily to the point where people said maybe we have to pass prohibition just to get them to cut back on the drinking they saw the drinking of the Veterans as something they needed to stop also they saw the huge immorality the veterans ever all these soldiers while they were over in Europe they were in France and notice the connotation date what is associated with France well it's a place completely consumed with pleasure seeking in immorality all they did over there when they weren't fighting was drinking and whoring and now they're coming back and doing the same thing here see they're French we need to stop that and so the veterans become the target of a lot of reform in fact both of the constitutional amendments are aimed at them to a large extent the reason why people are desperate enough to try these is to try to react to everything they're seeing that is a problem with the veterans does the veterans are returning in 1919 1920 is one of those Constitutional Amendments go through they are connected so progressivism caused a certain amount of discontent but combined with the war there was mass disillusionment in America and it wasn't just America that was disillusioned Europe is disillusion too the war disillusioned Europe but America is also being disillusion not just by the war but by all of this social change that they're starting to question keep in mind the reforms that progressivism brought are very controlled and people feel like they're being squeezed by Society by the government everybody's in their business telling them what to do this is supposed to be the land of the free People don't feel quite so free unpopular policies during something that they do one of the few times in America that we actually have conscription and by conscription I mean a draft being drafted into the army or the Navy or whatever in the military drafts are not particularly something that is popular with people forcing people into the military requiring them to serve in uniform is something that America tries to avoid most of the time but in World War 1 they called up a draft that's unpopular especially in rural communities keep in mind in in the cities if you lose someone okay you have maybe somebody in the family who isn't providing an income for that family but they can make it up in other ways but for Farms the most able-bodied people on the farm are between 17 and 25 years of age what ages are you getting drafted into the military around the same period and so the most able-bodied Farm Workers are being pulled out of the farms and a time when the nation needs more food production in order to support a foreign war effort you see the problem farmers are really against the draft and then there's the war time provisions of the government the government says well we're running short on this this and this we have to start rationing rationing is understandable and the country sucks it up and does it they know why it needs to be done but at the same time that doesn't mean it's popular so when all of a sudden they get told well if you want to buy beef you can only buy it on these days in these areas and you have to have a ration coupon in order to do it and once you used your rations that's all you get that's all the beef you can buy this leads of course the black market for the ration coupons people will sell them money but it also does something else whenever a product has abundance scarcity in other words it's harder to get what happens to the price and more time cause massive inflation in a lot of prices not just food all sorts of things are skyrocketing so the cost of living is going up but incomes are not and enough people in America are having a hard time making it as it is without the prices going through the roof businesses had been the target of much of the legislation to reform America during this period of time so the business world was now dealing with something they've never had to deal with before Washington is telling them what they have to do rather than the other way around businesses were used to being in the driver's seat now that relationship has to some extent flipped and businesses resent the government telling them what they can and cannot do with their own business the land of the free has turned into the land of the controlled and oppressed and they start reacting to it this pushback is largely directed against the progressive changes they blame the reformers for a lot of this control and saying well while some of that was definitely necessary and they will definitely say well you know we we did accomplish a lot but maybe we went too far in some areas and so there's a pushback against all of the reform that happened in a creek tons of reforms were passed in that period of time that's a lot of change for people to go through in a very short time and whenever you have that there's going to be people who want to slam on the brakes and say hold on let us catch our breath maybe we're moving too fast with this maybe we need to think this through a little bit more some people will say you know what I don't like the direction the country is going I'm afraid it's heading toward a dictatorship this is getting to control and some people will do something that is unique in America America is a country that traditionally is used to having people come to it immigrants right we tend to look at closing our borders to keep the flow of immigrants trying to get in to slow down or even stop that tends to be America's position however during this period of time you see something happen it is very rare in American history what is expatriation leaving basically yeah it's people saying you know what I don't want to be an American anymore I'm going to move somewhere else I'm going to leave here and go there America is used to being the place that receives not the place that a lot of people choose to bail especially people who have a public voice that's what's interesting about this people who write are among the people who are leaving and that means that they can write about why they're leaving that increases the dissolution because that's convincing other people are going I understand now some of the people I'm talking about how about Gertrude Stein one of the biggest voices in the rise of the feminist movement in the early 20th century she decided to leave America and go live in Paris and to the day she died she says I will always be in America that's where I live so she never quite gave up the idea of being an American but she didn't want to live there anymore she wanted to be in Paris where things were a little less obsessive about the control similarly Ernest Hemingway Ernest Hemingway was one of those people in World War one who was really screwed up the war met him up bad and what did he do he's crawled into a bottle and was on that endless search for intimacy like a lot of the veterans were and he has heavily been criticized by people for years about being an alcoholic and a philanderer so people are still passing judgment on him without understanding exactly why he wrote a book called The Sun Also Rises it's one of his biggest novels and it is almost autobiographical he doesn't use his own name but it's more or less based on his life and his experience somebody who is disillusion Somebody went home and found it wasn't home anymore and so he came back to Europe as the next Patriot he went to live down in Spain he got into bullfight that became his big passion he was a bullfighting official and otherwise he drank and he fornicated for the rest of his life it was a novel of most of the veterans it told people why the veterans were acting the way they were acting that's why it was so significant another person who actually that's got Fitzgerald Great Gatsby that author yeah Scott Fitzgerald said you know what I'm leaving I don't like it here anymore I'm going to go live over in Europe too and so he will expatriate eventually but what makes him even more interesting he is from the upper class the Fitzgerald's were a family of high social status they were the elites he went to Princeton at a time when Ordinary People don't go to Princeton the elite in the upper middle class can go to Princeton but if you're below that you're not going to get in it's not like today where anybody who makes the grades can get it back then you had to come from a certain social standing and he had it that's what made his writing all the more shocking so another thing people were worried about after the war that led them to have some backlash against the reforms is the reforms became more and more associated with socialist and in 1919 something big happens in America during the war businesses realized it would be unpatriotic or excuse me not businesses workers I mean rephrase that workers realize it would be unpatriotic to strike if they were to hold a strike during the war they could be labeled as treasonous and only one major strike happened during the war and boy were they hammered for they never really recovered from that after the war most of them said you know what we've got grievances we want to strike everybody knows it but we have to wait until the end of the war we can't do it now so everybody is coming up with this we've got to strike but we can't wait and it builds up and builds up and more and more wanted right but they're withholding until the end of the war so basically what we've got is a red light and all the cars that normally flow along the road a little bit here a little bit there they're all jamming up and as soon as the light turns green into the war all right time to strike and that scares people when you suddenly see more than 2,600 strikes Nationwide in one year what are you afraid of what's that yeah a revolution and this is all the more scary because this is 1919 just two years earlier there were not one but two Revolution in Russia the first was a socialist Revolution the second was a Communist Revolution and in that one they took the royal family out lined them all up against the wall and executed every last one of them the romanovs were wiped out the royal family from Russia was executed so that they could not be brought back to the throne people in America remember that and they're seeing all of the union strikes and instead of saying well this is understandable because of this this and this they're saying wow this this same thing is about to happen here if we don't step in and stop it and so America gets it's very first Redskin there have been two major red scares in America this is the first one the Red Scare was the fear that America was succumbing to bolshevism the Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin are the ones who ultimately had the second revolution that established what was become the Soviet Union okay ideas what's the job to a government agent now this is pre FBI there wasn't a Federal Bureau of Investigation if there had been at this point it would have gone to them instead it was simply a federal agent who they referred to typically as Gmail government men his name was Palmer and he was given the task of eradicating Communism and removing that threat from America and so he and other agents went after the Communist infestation now where they sought mostly was from Eastern Europeans Eastern Europeans were most of the people involved with the Communist Party although not exclusively needs to be said that they weren't alone but the people that he targeted typically were Eastern European and from a period from 1919 to 1921 he started rounding them all up businesses were happy to help him when they pointed fingers at union leaders the people that they did not like as a way to suppress the unions they say oh you should look at them you should look at them and Palmer goes and says you know you're right there's a there's a communist of I've ever seen one and they grab them and put them in Holden and in 1921 he loads all the people he rounded up over 4,000 of them put them on a ship sales that ship to the Soviet Union he then dumped them off and says congratulations you all wanted to be communist you are now in a communist country bye and leave this became known as the Palmer race okay the Red Scare also turned on a lot of progressive reformers but most notably was Jane Adams was not a socialist she was just somebody who wanted to bring good change for her country as she saw and felt it needed it she wanted to bring religious change she wanted to bring assistance to people and helping them see America in a good way rather than a bad way so Jane Adams again she was the woman who started the settlement house movement she was involved in a lot of different Progressive movements and when they started questioning her it became clear that people were trying to associate Progressive changes that had been made with Communism businesses were especially hoping that people would say yeah you know what we should undo some of that stuff roll it back a bit so part of this is a pushback against the changes that happened too quick but people are genuinely afraid of socialism this also takes on a religious aspect does anybody in here red Karl Marx anyone none of you if you get out of this University without cracking the Communist Manifesto and at least scanning it period the basis for Lennon's ideas talked about religion in a specific way he called it the opiate of the masses opiate of the masses what is an opiate is what a drug yes what's it used for okay can be used for Sedation what else can it be used for there's opiates that are regularly prescribed to people today Norco Percocet pain they mask pain do they get rid of the cause no they say this is what they should do but nobody does that okay even back then when the morals were a little bit more tight than they are today girls are expected to remain Chase yeah right marriage is hard it's not the dream that ends everything it's a daily struggle you have to fight to work out it is not a romantic thing at least not entirely remove anything can be but the point here is they look at the world through Rose Colored Glasses the romantic era is coming to a screeching Hall we are entering a new era of History the realest period and whether they realize I realize it or not what's going on with the generation gap is happening internationally and on a much larger scale not just between one generation and the next but between the shift from seeing things how you want them to be and how you'd like to believe them to be to how they really are and the war is what wakes people up hey War isn't glorious it isn't heroic it isn't celebrated it's gory and it's deadly and it ruins people's entire family destroys entire community this wasn't heroic this wasn't glorious this was 5 years of a meat grinder that killed 10 million people and wounded 15 million more that is what people are looking face to face with and that more than anything is pulling people up with their assumptions in maybe we ought to look at the realities of things a bit more question what we assume and start looking at what is and the younger generation are on the front edge of this that's why they start separate the older generation is still following that romantic mindset the younger generation is turning toward a real estate they're on the search for truth and they see their parents as liars and hypocrites worse than Liars they tell the lies and they believe that the lies are true even though lots of examples can be pointed at that say they're not okay adults are shocked when the morality starts changing on such a rapid and wide scale what area you see this is what the dress code in 1920 the average hemline for women's dresses and skirts was 9 inches above the ground they're showing plenty of ankle by this point but they're still going well okay that's not so bad by 1921 the hemline was up to 12 inches off the ground on it it froze in a year now you're just below the knee and the older General pornographic ally what's more other styles are becoming popular the nice conservative neckline 3 inches starts to drop it here and then here and they're showing up and people are going that's a lot of skin they are concerned the fabric starts becoming more and more filmy and translucent to where you can almost see the skin color coming through the dress this is frightening the older generation I can't believe this is going high heels on meanwhile the women who are wearing these Styles also start doing other things they start wearing  high heels or something that we're not common before this the Assam every now and then but not only do they give you more Heights but what else do you wear heels ladies yeah I see all the looks on your phone makes a little bit but looks when other men out there suddenly noticed " wow" oh yeah now before this who used cosmetics anyone who typically used cosmetics and so when these teenage girls start coming home with makeup on their face wearing high heels and these dresses that the parents think are rather inappropriate what's the reaction the older generation is genuinely scared of what's Happening smoking and drinking for women at least in public was absolutely frowned up and yet here during prohibition alcohol is supposed to be illegal and yet more and more people are getting drunk publicly than have in a long time why because it's fun to break the rules and the kids are rebelling they're rebelling against their parents they're rebelling against Society they're a billing against the restrictions on morality they're rebelling against a lot of stuff different names you probably heard it as the Roaring Twenties but it's also referred to as the Jazz Age music is changing who plays jazz who were those Jazz musicians who were so famous African Americans and the best jazz clubs we're black jazz clubs and a lot of the young white kids who wanted to go to the best jazz club for drinking and smoking and dancing because they love the music we're going to places like Harlem and their parents whether they admitted or not are very much in that racially biased mindset of that is that culture and ours is this culture and they really shouldn't be mixed so there is still this sense of white supremacy and separation so this miscegenation that's going on this intermixing it may not be anything more than just going and dancing to the music that they see this as a bad influence so it has a racial component to it but the dances they consider inappropriate the old dance slow methodical Ballroom dances but these dances are fast Charleston all over the place the foxtrot where if you want to dance the foxtrot properly the man and the woman who are dancing it they got to be smacked together because if you don't you won't be able to feel what the other person is doing and both of you are going to fall on your face so it forces people to be right up against each other which of course is part of the fun right is just uncorking over all of these changes so nice girls are now openly smoking in public all over the place and they are drinking illegally also keep in mind that one thing that made the Roaring Twenties roaring were some of the advantages that came with new technologies for example before you had lamps oil lamps when the sun went down you lit with lamps and candles and things like that now some of the homes especially if people who are a little more affluent have electricity this allowed you to dictate what you do any time of the day because hey middle of the night no big deal turn the lights on this allows them to have all my parties carbs another very important one cars are not always just a method of transportation sometimes they're the destination you know what I'm talking about cars are mobile privacy and so they can be used to get people to those late night parties or they could be used for two people to watch some of them okay so most parents don't really have a clue of what's going on until F Scott Fitzgerald tells them his very first novel was this side of paradise and keep in mind people know who Fitzgerald is they know his family his family is well known it'd be like saying Rockefeller you know who the Rockefellers are you may never have met him but you know who they are well they were a famous family they were high steps so when F Scott Fitzgerald puts out this book and they start reading it they're scandalized by what he's writing he's talking about how young people are getting together in big parties to turn into petting parts basically it's not quite orgy okay I'm not talking about that but figure a lot of people are getting the first and second base maybe not there asking for it or look it up online Google it don't embarrass yourself okay so something else that's changed I want to go back to the dress code a little bit there's something else very significant that's changing back in this period of time women in America especially war of particular article of clothing religious and most of you would cringe if you had to do it today it's called a corset you know what of course it is some of them men are going like this others are going the women all know do you like them brace that goes around your midsection and pulls in your stomach and your your midsection into a really tight form and the whole idea here is to really give you that nice hourglass figure and have your clothes hang really well so that everything looks like it's supposed and the problem with the corset is it's not exactly the healthiest thing to wear especially the way they were you ever seen those old movies where a woman Fates and a man carries her off to a couch and Ten's door and gives her air and maybe some water that actually happened a lot reason corset they can't breathe a flight of stairs that's enough to make them gasping for air that's tough and so if you really want to put a corset on right it's actually a three-person job three people to put on one corset one person holds it in place another person is pulling the two sides together as tightly as they go and a third person is very quickly lacing it up it can loosen up and the Lady Gaga breathe when the men come home from war they're used to being around French women and in France the course it was not very common and so when they come home they start having social engagements dances were very common and they're dancing with women and going what are you wearing is this armor what do you got a chastity belt might have to get a blow torch to get you out of this corset corset I don't like it when I dance with a woman I want to feel a woman no I don't like your corset gone so that's got Fitzgerald this is just sensationalist he's meant to try to create Scandal where there really isn't one check it out they're doubtful that it's real but no we really and what scares them is that he is absolutely 100% right on the money this is going on not just occasionally all over the place and the parents say okay we got to do something about this and the religious group are saying we definitely have to do something about this we have to save the morality of our country lots of different ways one way they're doing it also is talking about sex publicly now there's still a bit of a taboo about talking about sex publicly isn't there you go down to Starbucks and somebody's talking about a wild crazy night they in there significant other just had and they're doing it in very loud volume where everybody can hear it it kind of makes everybody a little uncomfortable doesn't it you don't really want to hear about somebody else talking about their sex yeah so this is something that is still kind of there but back then it was really tough you just don't talk about sex that's however young people got around this it was considered modern to talk about progress and science knowledge scholarship and one of the leading scientists at this point in time was generating a lot of interest is an Austrian psychologist his name study of analyzing dreams and he was the founder of psychoanalysis which is still used today to get into somebody's psyche and figure out what motivates him and you know what he found sex is the big motivator for most people in most situations that the underlying impulse is this need to procreate as a species he says this is part of our makeup we need Next Generation to come along and the way Humanity survives is through sex and so we are driven to it and so it's the motivation for a lot of our Behavior this was controversial but it makes a certain amount of sense and so the kids when they go out talking about sex in public when people finally settle down and after F Scott Fitzgerald Clues them in they're looking at the group of young women who are wearing the scanty clothing and dancing to Jazz drinking and smoking in public what do we call women who did all that what is it no no sex for it they're just out there having a good time drinking smoking dancing dressing and very what's that well you can describe they were called flappers because they get the name from the steps of the Charleston which was said to Jazz it was a very fast-paced dance where they kind of kick and flap their legs and arms and stuff and so people say oh well look at them they're flappers so there's a backlash against all of this the religious groups especially Protestant but not exclusively there are some Catholics and Jews who are also reacting to this start putting out speeches about how there's so much overabundant nudity in the world the indecent dance style and they point to the offensive dressing styles of the young ladies they push legislatures in their own areas to start doing something about this you've got to stop this pass some laws your regulate stuff keep in mind they've learned over the past 20 years and more this is how you deal with things the religious community motivated by the social gospel movement brought about social change through legislation you got to do that again do something about this religiously are thinking yeah what exactly can we do about this but they do try or at least they put some proposals out there they know those proposals will not be approved they're counting on keep that in mind in Utah 1921 there was a law proposed in the Utah State Legislature that would provide for any hemline that was more than three inches above the ground any woman who had a hemline higher than that would face fines and potential imprisonment for violating the law did not pass similarly in Virginia Allah was considered proposed where it says if any more than three inches not approved Ohio proposed to law that would prevent the sale of and this is a direct quote garment that which unduly displays or accentuates the lines of a female's figure first how do you judge that second what do you expect her to do wear a burlap sack for the rest of her life if clothing is going to fit their curves are going to come out somehow or another so what is duly or undoing can't really make it enforceable of course the law doesn't pass why did they propose him did they think the laws were passed no they're counting on them not but by putting that proposal out there whenever anybody says how come you're not doing something about it they can say I propose this restriction look at it I proposed it but they voted against it I can't be held for what they vote for but I put it out there I like that yes you're right you are doing what you can and you can't control what the other legislators it's their problem and that's kind of how people approach this whole thing they know this would be a real mess if it ever became law they're not going to go down that pound meanwhile the more controlling their parents try to get the more the younger generation Rebels it's like taking a handful of sand when you're out of the beach if you keep your hand nice and open the sandal stay there you can hold it like that for as long as you want Sam's going to more or less stay there but as soon as you try to squeeze it what happens to the sand from that control so younger generation starts rebelling a lot more they start invading their parents we're good kids were not really evading their parents their parents think they are just to get away from them for a couple hours and when they do do that and they catch him they assume the worst oh who have you been sleeping with you dirty minded hit I haven't been sleeping with anyone you automatically jump to the worst possible conclusion don't you tell that your mind is one in the gutter not mine and that becomes a weapon to use against their parents their parents of course get very Stern about that and this is just driving the generation further and further apart religious leaders of the time actually say you know why don't we take a step back and realize that every generation modifies the generations before it in their moral idea which is true you're going to see that with your own kids when you start having them if you start having them their generation will see things a little differently than your generation just as your generation sees things a little differently than my generation does on the hole and similarly mine to my parents okay so every generation modifies the moral code they say this is actually refreshingly honest look at them they are not hiding anything it's all out in the open about it they're being very open about it so don't worry about this this will blow over it's just a face they were wrong the traditionalist understanding the older Generations understanding of what is happening that world war one was to blame the war had awoken the Youth of the Nation to its own mortality is one of the first things you think of am I going to be alive at the end of the day does that go through your minds Maybe okay but most people they're not thinking wow today is today I can be dead especially when you're in your teens in 20s that's not high on the list of things but for the soldiers over in World War one that's very much the case I wonder if today's the day that I turn into that Carnage out there I wonder if my guts are going to be the guts hanging on that barbed wire this time 3 Doors Down for me and I get to see him rotting out there in no man's life so the older generation thinks that they've been awoken to the realities of death too early and this is leading to pleasure seeking behavior in other words in the old Roman adage eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die of this generation hey we could die tomorrow we could die The Day After Tomorrow we don't know we don't know how much time we've got left so we need to live life to the fullest let's enjoy it and so they're living like there is no tomorrow and that's how the older generation sees with the younger generation is done also politically President Wilson was talking about during this fight during World War I over the colonies of the Ottoman Empire that had fallen apart well this is largely part of why World War I was five Austria and Russia were both trying to take control of Southeastern Europe the part of the Ottoman Empire that both of them wanted a pizza okay and as a result of this he said rather than just keeping them colonies and switching ownership why don't we let them decide for themselves their future why don't we let them be countries on their own we give them self-determination and self-determination became a political buzzsprings during this period of time and the parents are afraid that the kids have heard self-determination and changed it into self gratification they've learned the wrong lesson from what was being said the youth understanding of what's happened their parents live in a dream world where they lie to themselves and then they believe it they are romanticizing everything without seeing things how they really are they talk about the evils of alcohol but they've got a bottle hidden in the back of the cupboard they talk about how women shouldn't be smoking but as soon as mom thinks there's nobody around first thing she does is the light up and all of a sudden the young people see them for the Hypocrites they really are and are they right are they hypocrites actually yeah they kind of are it's not so much that morality has really shifted all that much it's more that you can see it as long as it was behind closed doors nobody really said anything about it but as soon as it becomes public it becomes a problem they're just lying to themselves they're hypocrites what's more they see that the older generation constantly is trying to put on errors to convince people that they're better than they actually are they accept the speech pattern that emphasizes an exaggerated gentility in other words you ever heard somebody talking in a very what are you just talk straight say what you mean quit putting all this flowery talk in it you're making an ass of yourself that's essentially what they're saying they want to strip the language of it's falsity they want to strip the lies away from what the parents say things should be but they know as kids they're seeing the reality of it they said they're living in this romanticized world and we see the reality the kids are on a search for truth they seek truth are you going to go to a hypocrite if you're looking for truth no you're going to look for it elsewhere and that's essentially what the kids are doing so what's truly disturbing to the older generation is not that the generation up and coming is modifying the world code they understand completely checking it there is no moral code they replaced the image of the noble woman as the gate keeper reality in this very pure figure with someone else this new woman is Guinea drunken cigarette smoking alcohol drinking that's the new one they said we've got it inside and the religious community is really the driving force behind the backlash against this backlash notice the potential one just keep swinging back and forth progressivism reaction reaction to the reaction and the train starts out fairly small on the tracks and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger as it gets closer to the camera and about the time that it's filling up the entire camera people go start running from the room from that point they were hooked they love movies we still do and the movies during this period of time we're significantly more sexually graphic than the movies that will come out from the 30s to the early 60s the twenties actually got a little bit loose when it came to the moral standards they were a bit more sexually explicit they didn't actually show sex I mean we have that quite a bit in our movies today but don't judge them by the same standards by their standards it would be like going and seeing p*** flick in the movie theaters by the older Generations mindset oh yeah acquainted with new stars Rising on the Silver Screen it became what are known today as Rudolph Valentino play that last name Valentino what would you say his ethnicity would be Italian maybe Hispanic of some kind Latin just throw it in the Latin category okay Rudolph Valentino it's playing on this whole Latin lover Valentino was not his real name and he wasn't Italian but he played that so that he could be one of those romantic sex symbols why because white Anglo-Saxon Protestants can't be sections or Eastern European lovers but wide angle section Western European stock that was unacceptable so there's still a rules on what you can put on the screen but as long as the person was portrayed as somebody other than white Anglo sex and Protestant you're good this game rides to a new class of women in screen Vamps and she was very famous for her portrayal of Cleopatra at one point and if you actually Google Cleopatra eat a Barra it'll pop up a picture that is very famous of her rather scantily clothed laying lots of Skin showing heavy makeup dark hair and The Vamps were seen as dangerous women they were always women with the dark side but you could go with sexuality so the big name for the bombshell period where you see these women sex symbols emerge Greta Garbo Garbo was really the first big bombshell of the cinema world but Vamps were part of that explicit sexuality the problem here is first young people are starting to go so that's how you do it they're treating the movies as if they're instructional they're looking at them as instructions and the other big problem for people was the sex scandals in Hollywood that were becoming public we're giving Hollywood a bad name it was one thing for the movies to be criticized it was a very different one for the actual real life actors doing things that were drawing negative attention to the industry so much so that Hollywood will actually do something the business in America and very rarely has ever done self-regular they voluntarily get together and say we need to regulate this ourselves the government didn't step in and say you need to deal with this they did it themselves they said maybe we are getting a little too overboard on this we need to scale it back from that point on by the late 20s early 30s you see a big change they still allude to sex but you won't see the graphic nature of it you won't see hugely scantily clad you won't see people embracing and and going crazy and clearly about ready to get it on close the door and it fades to Black you know what happens in there you don't have to see it and that's how Hollywood will treat it from that point on and by the time we get to the fifties you have Ricky and Lucy I Love Lucy they sleep in separate beds anybody believe that one twin beds in the bedroom yeah how does little Ricky come along if they're so progressivism had died but the core of the progressivism was always the Social Gospel movie and that was still alive and well now the social gospel movement is trying to take on a lot of these things putting speeches out there about how the styles are going to change they try to put out propaganda to convince the kids that the styles are going to get longer and longer and longer kids don't buy it there's a number of other things that rise that they consider a crisis of protestantism a religious crisis the erosion of moral standards was part of it but more than that the rise of civil marriages instead of church marriages instead of people getting married in the church a lot more people are going down to the justice of the peace getting a judge to Marion so City Hall becomes a much more commonplace for people to get married the rise of domestic Catholics 1/3 of America is Catholic by the end of the 20s this is one of the things that's driving the Ku Klux Klan they're able to recruit a lot of people because people are really scared about the number of Catholics that are in America 1/3 be ignoring of the prohibition laws drives the Protestants nuts those Social Gospel reformers who finally accomplished what they wanted they banned alcohol not only did not shut it down alcohol consumption is getting higher and higher every year also disturbing to religious communities is a new growing approach to things in Academia it's called cultural relativity religions are not actually divinely inspired they are social constructs that people create so what your practicing as a religion isn't something that God inspired you to it's something that people use in order to create a moral guideline for their community social control also you see the rise of new areas of academics Fields up to this point when people looked at religions other than Christianity there was judgment implied they are looking at a religion say Buddhism for example well clearly Buddhists are not the proper thing and they went in with that mindset automatically now they're saying let's take away the judgment and let's just look at what they believe and what they practice and how it is applied in their lives and they do that with other religions around the world rather than implying that one is right and the rest are wrong study religion that was disturbing to people in this period of time the question that their way might not be right wow they would not accept that science is what a lot of them will point to send this whole idea of progress and modernity they're pointing to science and you know who the scientist who is really responsible for all of this immorality all the people that we're dealing with today Darwin if this whole idea that God didn't create people they got created from the Apes they evolved into people they weren't created as people we were monkeys once oh yeah I buy that and they start pointing the finger at Darwin and they will start pushing legislators to pass regulations throughout the 20s and there's more reason than this than just people turning against religion although Veterans as a whole typically look at religion as I only go to church for two things in life marrying and very the rest of it they can have that's how veterans are starting to react to the church others</p>
