<p>And zero okay yeah it's it's more like the you're probably seeing the score off of the exam and for some reason you're seeing the previous score rather than the curved score and you're only supposed to see the curb score you know so that you don't get this kind of confusion so I'm going to have to look and see what's causing this and see if I can fix it I haven't typically had that problem but yeah the grades were curbed this week and if you're seeing your end score as being zero on average that's definitely something I need to take a look at make sure we get it fixed okay but yes the Great okay so when we were talking last time about the second right away we've been talking about Limon Beecher and he had a little bit more conservative approach he was starting to allow some emotion in and encourage people to get excited about their religion but he kept it limited he didn't want things getting too emotional and he became a big critic of Charles Finney who was in a way kind of one of the people who was inspired by Beecher and grew out of that experiential approach the religion and Vinny will Embrace emotionalism and encourage it he will turn it loose and so emotionalism is becoming much more part of what's going on at this point in time also people had social reasons to want this emotional release the times during this early 1800s in America were tough this was a time of the first Industrial Revolution a lot of people's lives were changing they were in flux some people found themselves out of work if that happened what did they do to try to feed their families you know what could they what could they do in response to those hard times and so this constant life of anxiety of feeling like your life is always on the edge of failure that will drive people to drink that'll drive people to look for escapism though it'll drive some people to cry and so they have to start looking at the problems as saying hey what's wrong with America is a social construct we need to fix it and there's this belief that America is fixable and it begins with the individual it's this concept of perfectionism perfectibility people are perfectible and really through Charles Finney you really hear that language come out in his speaking he is big on pushing this idea of you can perfect yourself and buy it you can a perfect union I mean notice that it's even referring to some of the language of the hope of the founders of the Constitution this is right in the wording of the constitution in order to form a more perfect union well that's what they're trying to do they're embracing some of that revolutionary pervert from earlier in there their lives and they see the problems and they're trying to fix them standpoint and religious motivations but this reform that starts out in this period of time to challenge some of the problems that have risen up those are real concerns and people are trying to take a firm hand in the correction of the social bills now keep in mind that part of what's the problem is the revolution itself some people revolted from high means high and mighty ideals the standards and language of the Revolution you guys have heard it why did the American Revolution happen what were they protesting what was the basis of the revolution no taxation without representation yes that was the big catch phrase of the American Revolution we demand representation a voice in our own governing and for the people at the bottom they heard the no taxation part they didn't care about the rest and when they succeeded what they learned was hey with mass Insurrection we can force the government off our backs permanently and we can live however we want so with this is a certain underlying mental Anarchy that's going on a lot of people resent any kind of government control over their life and these people are problem in society that's part of the underpinnings of the chaos that's emerging this lower underbelly of society is getting a little bit more forward because anytime the American government now tries to put controls on the people and so the 1800s that first decade of the 1800s under Thomas Jefferson he started seeing riots break out everywhere civil violence is breaking out all over the place and by the 1820s and 30s people are said okay this needs to stop we need to identify what the problem is and fix it and so religious reform is created out of this temperance people were consuming alcohol in never before and never since seen quantity the average Americans started drinking as soon as they got up and went to bed they had a glass of whiskey next to the bed when they went to bed and as soon as they got up they started drinking again and that's not just men men women even children were drinking alcohol all day and it's not like a drink or two or getting a little tipsy no they were consuming staggering amounts of alcohol what would normally put you on your butt would have just kept them functional okay you guys consume a fifth of whiskey in a day you're going to be plastered you're probably going to go pass out and wake up with a hangover besides of Texas well back then drinking that much on a daily basis was routine throughout the day they drank that much everyone kids might have drank a little less but drinking in huge quantities who's coming and this became one of the biggest reforms that they wanted to address let's get people to cut back on drinking they know they're not going to get alcohol outlaw and they're not even trying to do that they're just trying to convince people hey look what you're doing and look what it's doing to you cut back on the booze drink in more moderation temper your use of alcohol that's why it becomes known as the temperance movement so alcohol was big enough also are trying to convince poor people who are wasting their money on alcohol and gambling and prostitutes saying hey why don't you spend your money a little more constructively so Thrift became a big cause spend your money on what you need quit buying what you immediately feel you need to cope with with things instead instead of picking up a bottle of booze with your money why don't you take some food home feed your family with that money instead and so spend your money correctly spend your money wisely Thrift became a big movement another big push that was especially strong in New England was education education that is supported publicly now as good new Republican Society had to figure out how to be Republicans it had never really been done before and they were going into whole new territory they realize that they need a population of civic-minded people who had the proper education and knew what being Republican meant as far as everybody knew up to this point the only experience I had was operating in a monarchy they didn't know what being a republican meant well it meant that they need schools and so New England especially was pushing heavy for schools publicly funded schools the South however was very resistant to this the reason is the way schools are funded How are schools funded taxes what kind of taxes property taxes property taxes is really the reason up in New England people have the property ownership spread out over many more people okay you don't see one particular group of people in society that have to put the bill for everybody it's pretty evenly distributed so they're willing to take that on it's more equal more utilitarian among their society to put in into action the burden is spread nice and evenly down on the south that wouldn't be the case if it's funded by property taxes it means the slave owners the ones with the massive plantations they are the ones who are putting the bill for everyone else they own most of the land in the South they might be the top one to one and a half percent but they own 90% of the land and that means 90% of the tax bill will fall on them and they're saying now wait a minute I'm not going to spend all of my hard-earned money so that a bunch of work with people of masses can go get educated if they want education let him get it themselves and so there was resistance the attitudes about education took hold and they became part of the local character of people in those parts of the country today the best gun best schools in the country are up in New England this is still true they have the best schools with the best test scores up there in New England you take a look at the worst Deep South and so those patterns still are with us even though slavery is long gone the patterns for education and distribute of the funds for Education the willingness to publicly support it just isn't there as much in the south a religious Quest it was your religious duty to be clean they figured if Society was perfectible and the individual is perfectible first if you want to clean somebody's mind they need to have a clean body the Japanese were bathing every day or at least every two days and they had been for centuries but in the western world most of Europe is still on that one month cycle well it's the last day of the month I guess I better pay that kind of thing and so Europe's fascination with America they see America as a bizarre place obsessed with bodily cleanliness and everything about what they do is connected with time they have a new phrase in America time is money everything is done if you are wasting time you're wasting the potential to make money and this is also put into religious terms if you are wasting time you are wasting God's time and God wants you to be productive God wants you to do something with your life if you're out to self improve yourself and Society and the nation you have to be somebody who's willing to work put in that time don't waste it and time Obsession became something of almost a pseudo religion in America in and of itself time is money this obsession with time was radiated throughout American society Frenchman Alexis de tocqueville wrote a very famous book called a democracy in America he came over during this period of time and studied Americans watch them look that they went through their new experiments in Republican democracy and he was baffled and fascinated by what he saw he's talking about this because this is this is encroaching into an area that no country has done as far as they can tell ever not like this America is a unique place they have unique customs that are emerging out of this new Republican mindset and one of those is the serious obsession with time everything they do has to be efficient they have to save time wherever they can eating he comments on how Americans eat really fast if they sit around the table they don't sit around talking about their their day and enjoying the social interaction over a meal the way dining traditionally has been done instead they sit there have the food in front of them and scarf it down as fast as they can and then boom they're off doing other things Alexis de tocville was the name of this guy and the book was Democracy in America if you have not read the topville or even part of the Tokyo's book before you get out of college somebody screwed up you should read part of that book if not the entire book before you get out of college that is one of the great pieces of social history of the 19th century so time obsession America also became very committed to Accurate clocks if you're going to turn obsession over time up to this level you're going to want to be able to measure it accurately right after all if you can measure the time accurately you know exactly how much money you're going to make so all of this is part of American culture but it also has some Reflection from the religious activism in this period of time but the religious activism is also a response to the tensions that people feel about this if people are always obsessed over time inefficiency they're always learn should I be doing this should I be doing this year I'd be doing this they are so tightly wound they need an outlet for that in that outlet has been booze revivals offer them a new outlet religious they offer them a religious output revivals while they focus on some of these areas of society they also focus on the home quit cheating on your spouse stay loyal don't abandon your family family devotion piety that kind of thing these other social causes all blend into this belief that there is a religious reason to improve that something has gone wrong in God's plan and we need to put it right that's why things are messed up they have religious reasons to fix it part of this is an outgrowth of manifest destiny they have a desire to civilize the savagery of the West to spread their idea of civilization into this Savage world and what they've come to realize is the Savage re is converting the Civilized people into one civilized people more and faster than the opposite can make happen that civilized people can transform the savagery it's creating more Savages essential and so part of what they want to do is take a more religious and moral minded people West and so part of that Western movement that will occur larger large amounts of it are going to be heavily religiously driven to where they're trying to take religion with them they're not just transporting Humanity out west they're transporting religion and the social cultural beliefs that Americans hold valuable so that becomes part of this whole manifest destiny if you're not taking the religious ideas with it what's the point there's no point to go in West if you're not expanding that with it because of the religious activism and the heavy emotional content a lot of people come to really like the more emotional approach to practicing religion and in this you see a new group rise the previously has been fairly small but is growing larger and larger throughout the Evangelical movement of the Second Great Awakening and that is the rise of a group called the best now after this point Presbyterians and methodists are the two big denominations in America along with congregationalists methodists are a little bit more liberal and tolerance of emotionalism Vinny for example is a Methodist but with the Baptist they're fully embracing the emotional and they see it as their primary duty to convert the unconverted that the reason America is having the problems is because there's so many Godless people out there so they need to get people Godly again it's their job to go out and convert people so missionary activities religious conversion become the driving force behind Baptists and that remains True to this day Baptists are still heavily focused on converting and fixing what's wrong the revivals are an outgrowth of these various concerns where religious groups and leaders put out these one week or two week sessions where people hold regular meetings and get fired up over that period of time and then the Revival moves on to a new location that's how they work and the people running these revivals became known as evangelist just as George Whitefield was kind of the first big evangelist others will follow his pattern the Baptists are going to get really active holding me but the Presbyterians will still hold them sometimes and the Methodist will hold him a little bit more actively than the Presbyterian but really the Methodist and especially the Baptist are going to be the ones heavily holding Revival today most of the revivals that are still active in America and there are still revivals being run are by the past they're the ones running typically that's where you see a lot of these Revival activities still today why do revivals have so much appeal and it does not matter what class you're in you're feeling it Working Class People are dealing with the bills of poverty they're dealing with hopelessness they're dealing with the need to have some kind of purpose in life something to give them directions something they can restore their faith in their future Revival software that whenever things are hard people will often turn to religion as a way to cope with that difficulty that is a standard not just Christianity but you get outside of the Christian World non-christians other religions work the same way in their own areas as well wherever you see things get hard people will have an upstairs of religious activities it happens here too so the poor are looking for ways to cope they're looking for hope they're looking for help in many cases revivals can help offer that for the middle class they are so tightly wound they need to uncork okay and revivals are a pressure valve they give them that pressure release in a healthy way not a destructive way instead of going home and picking up the bottle they go and get active religiously and even after the Revival is gone they continue that religious activity and at least once a week they get to uncork they are more responding to these religious ideas if you are religiously active it means that you are trying to fix yourself trying to improve yourself and that's positive because if you're improving yourself you're going to improve your business your entire way of life will benefit from that so essentially going to church is showing a desire for the middle class to get ahead and so even if they don't take it completely to Heart they will still go and they will still be active because being active shows that they want to be upwardly mobile but it does give a lot of people in the middle class who are looking out at America saying what's wrong with this place we need to fix it it gives them an outlet to do exactly that other people who are similarly minded come together in these revivals and they say hey let's talk about creating something to come back alcohol let's talk about something that we can do about getting people to spend their money wisely and they come up with these ideas that are personally resonant to them and get involved with other people who are that way in the revivals provide a foundation for that to happen so the middle class driven reform movements of this period of time are also something fed by the revivals women we talked about women especially responding to the revivals in a big way two to one women outnumbered revivals at Finney's and while his was still slightly higher than the rest women greatly outnumber men at all of the revivals there are a number of reasons for this first of all why are there fewer men at the revivals what do you think do women have jobs no most women are not employed it is socially unacceptable a lot of people will not hire women on principle women are supposed to be people of the home domestic they are supposed to take care of the kids in the house they're supposed to be the nurturers of the family they are not supposed to be working that's what the men are supposed to do so if they're holding revivals during the day who has time to go women do they're not going to work some men get permission to go to work permission to get off work to go to these other people are out of work completely and they've got no restriction whatsoever they can go if they want so part of it is the availability more women are available to go but women are getting a lot from the revivals this is an important thing here for the women they're facing a lot of challenges a lot of changing in society is going on women are getting more vocal about their rights it's slow but it's building and they're looking for ways to express that Revival start getting giving them an outlet and people like Finney starting encouraging them to take that outlet hey go ahead get up in front and talk give it a try you don't say anything that's what you're doing now and so he encourages this is feeding into this desire of women to start taking on more civic responsibility but also the decline of arranged marriages a lot of women young people in general rebel against their parents during this early Republic and wanted to pick their own mates rather than fight them on it they their parents basically said okay well let's go ahead and allow it the problem is women came to realize that arranged marriages mean safety usually the parents had a vested interest in choosing a stable partner somebody who is good for their kids that's not always the case but it usually is and as a result arranged marriages tend to provide a woman with more stability into the future but now that they are falling out of favor women have to find their own matches and they're not quite sure how to go about that especially since so many men are also looking West oh I'm going to go make my life out in the west will take me with you I'd love to go no no no that's not something a woman should have to do go back and I'll get a wipe when all the hard stuff is done and we can start building a life together that kind of thing and the women are standing there watching the men leave and most of the men who are leaving are the perfect marriageable age young men who have the energy the strength the endurance to deal with setting up a new life somewhere else this is not an easy thing to do the women are getting left behind and they're going man people we have to choose from it's getting Slim Pickens they want to expand their social networks well revivals do that revivals get them out of only their own little community and start connecting multiple churches from wider areas and bringing all those people in together and as they do those people begin interacting and the women get a lot more opportunity to meet men so you're big for women another group that they were big Forest slaves slaves find themselves getting included in a lot of the religious activities in fact a lot of people include anti-slavery as one of the big reforms that they want to bring about in America a lot of people thought that slavery was on its way out with the Revolution and in fact many states even while the Revolution was going on we're starting to say let's set the stage for phasing slavery out in the revolutionary period while the war was still technically on Vermont free their slaves Pennsylvania will free their slaves in 1780 the ending of the Revolutionary War was 1783 so that was pre-revolution and so a lot of places are looking at hey let's go into this embracing and so you start seeing more and more States especially in the north pushing that idea some places in the Deep South they're more resisted to that and this anti-slavery movement because it doesn't take hold but actually slavery expands and gets even bigger than it was before a lot of people are saying this is why America so screwed up and we need to deal with the main problem freeing the slaves so there are people who want to end slavery a lot of the slaves are religious that doesn't necessarily mean the slaves are Christian although most of them are most of the slaves are either Methodist or Baptist maybe this is an acceptable one because after all if they're not looking for their freedom now but looking for it in the afterlife they're less likely to revolt does that make sense absolutely it makes sense so where does that lead to a lot of slaves will start looking to their own for leadership but remember what I said earlier in the in the Race part where the black slaves who rise up and start becoming the leaders of these churches what's the problem with them they know how to read and the master did not groom them for a leadership they're not like the slave drivers who are treated as special better different they are treated but they can read their literate that makes them dangerous and in fact the worst flavor bolt in the United States period was led by a slave preacher and his name was Nat Turner Nat Turner was reading the Bible from cover to cover it took him some time he wasn't that good but keep in mind being literate does not mean you are educated it just means you have the ability to read not that you have the ability to fully understand what it is you're reading and that was the problem with that Turner he got to a particular point in the Bible and it was frankly a book that slave owners would probably not want slaves to read but there's one book of the Bible that you don't want your slave to read what would that book be what's that Revelation no they probably wouldn't be able to understand that it sounds like somebody who's what else Exodus exactly Exodus is all about how the nation of Israel was enslaved by the Egyptians Moses rose up led a massive slave Insurrection and led the people out of Egypt to the promised land where they established a nude Town Jerusalem to be the holy area and that Turner was reading this thing he says I know where Jerusalem is that's the answer and he says Jerusalem that's just a few miles down the road Jerusalem Virginia you didn't know it wasn't the real dream there are lies the real problem remember when I said education is not inherent in being literate he thought the real Jerusalem was the one just down the road so he convinced his people that he was speaking for God that he was chosen to leave them out of bondage and he led them on a journey down the road was he right no the lights heard about the big wave of violence the massive slave Uprising there was led by a black preacher a slave preacher a slave who is literate and their worst fears were made manifests when southern slave owners go to sleep at night and have nightmares what is it they dream about slaves rising up and hacking their families to pieces that's what terrifies them that is the Boogeyman under the bed so to speak and then they hear about Nat Turner and what's worse is they didn't capture turn he and several others were still on the loose they ran out into the swamps of Virginia were hiding out now they were on the Run but people in the South thought it was a really good time to visit friends up in New York and so you'll see basically a mass Exodus of slave owners is they go visit Northern friends for a while until people get control of Nat Turner and once they do capture not turn they hold a big big public trial stop it the slave owners got brutal and part of this will feed the rising Abolitionist Movement as well keep in mind that this is going to horrify a lot of people in America what they do to Nat Turner they want to set an example so they have a force of a trial where all the slaves in the area are brought in to watch it Turner is put on trial he is condemned to be executed if that were simply hanging him that wouldn't be that big of a deal but they want to make a point they start with playing is where they peel your skin off while you're still alive to enjoy it and then they've been affect you where they pull out your internal organs and play with them while you get to watch hey what's this for do you think he needs it I don't know not sure and they will start pulling the various pieces out and have a conversation with the person hey do you think you need this I don't think you do maybe we can put this one aside what do you think hey does this hurt oh yeah I guess it does that kind of stuff and then still not done big drawn quartering that's where they tie all of your arms and legs to an individual horse they shoot the horse out horses out in four different directions and it rips your arms and legs completely off your body and only the Torso remains and finally they decide okay let's end it for good and they beheaded are they done no they're still not done they take him to six different places every part of them that's left he's in six pieces now the Torso the head and four limbs six and all of those pieces is buried in a different place and every place they're buried they run horses over the top of it so that no one person knows where all of his pieces remain they have condemned him to the worst form of death that they could possibly imagine this was brutal and a lot of people in the north are going whoa it's one thing to execute him what to do that that's just wrong we need to do something about slavery in this country and so for a lot of people this will be an Impulse to rise into the anti-slavery movement to become an abolitionist somebody who will fight against it religious reasons some slaves also who are religious will reject Christianity and instead they will try to practice their Africanized religions from back home but slave importation was really declining and by the 1820s there weren't a lot of slaves getting brought in anymore they outlawed the slave importation trade from Africa but America already had enough slaves in place to where they could perpetuate the next generation of slaves and so a lot of the slaves were second third fourth generation well how do you perpetuate a religious tradition that you had no part in ever practicing in person you go off of what you were told by your parents your grandparents maybe your great-grandparents and what they tell you is what you learn so they're practicing it second hand at best for the most part which means it's going to have gas and the religious practice can't have gaps they need to fill those gaps in they need to have something to do for those and so they fill it in with things that they know what do they know Christianity they may not believe Christianity but some of the things that they fill those gaps with are out of Christian ideology what you end up getting is a weird mixture of African religious Traditions Christian religious Traditions combining and creating something new something different than both of them it is neither African nor Christian it is something else this is where Voodoo comes from this is where Santa Maria comes from Conjuring was another big one that rose up are referred to as synchronism that is the taking of bits and pieces of different religions rather than pulling people over to one side or the other they create essentially a third group somewhere in the middle that are distinct in and of themselves syncretism the practice of combining two different ideas from two different cultures into a third and religions are where you really saw this come to play one thing the slave communities are remembered for today and something that is still kind of kept alive and passed on is the knowledge of slave spirituals the songs that slaves sang in the field to express their religious desire for freedom in the afterlife Swing Low Sweet Chariot is probably the most famous of these but there are many and there are people who have tried to document and save those over time so there are repositories for you can find that but these slave spirituals became a way of expressing these feelings while they worked in the field but they also became forms of communication if people felt that there was something going on that everybody needed to know about they had signals to communicate some of those things by picking up certain songs for example if somebody on the plantation died they had a song that would let them know somebody was dead so that when they got off work and went home that night back to the slave quarters they would be ready for whatever news they were going to get and the way it would work is somebody who hurt it would start singing a certain song that was only song at those times and then others would start singing the song and it would pass on through the fields as they heard other people singing they would start singing it too that was how they passed some signals so it did become a way of communicating as well but it also showed the Deep religious commitment that a lot of the slaves felt to the religious up search during this period of time and the great this period of the second right Awakening this huge up surge of religious activism led a lot of the Baptist to really make an effort to convert slaves they felt that the slave Souls were as important as the non-slaved souls that they needed to convert both of them now I promised you to leaders to talk 3 l to talk about we've only talked about two so far Lyman Beecher was the first one we talked about and Charles Finney he was the second one we talked about let's talk about the third now he was a little different but also very influential part of what is underlying this period again is this idea of perfectionism I can perfect myself I can build a perfect community and I can build a perfect Society what do we call that Utopia yes utopianism there's an underlying utopianism in the in the Second Great Awakening that is permeating culture and society and it comes out with this third guy his name was Joseph Smith Jr Joseph Smith Jr was somebody who took a little concern with the overemotional practice of religion and he was really Disturbed with the problems of society he had a religious experience where he wrote down what he saw in his vision he believed God was speaking to him and he wrote that message down into a single piece of work it will eventually come to be known as The Book of Mormon a group of followers that will follow him are Mormons so this is the rise of Mormonism now at first it sounded like he was an offshoot of just very conservative Christianity he was concerned about too much emotion getting into the place of religion which a lot of people were but he said you know basically what's going on here the reason we're having so many problems all the changes we've made here in America are disrupting the Ancient Order of Things there is an ancient order that has been alive for thousands of years of how societies function no the Ancient Order of Things the man provides the food he goes out provides protection he works for providing for the family the mother raises the kids and takes care of the home he says that is the natural way of things and we're getting away from that those systems are being disrupted so we're going to put things right we need to restore he forms a religious commune in Illinois called Nauvoo Nauvoo now who was a settlement for people who were following his ideas and said yeah let's build a society where we can start really putting forward our ideas so they created a local town government within their community at one point he suggested that they own all property commonly communally and they all objected they said what do we look like Indians to you and he says no no that's okay we can still do this with individual ownership and they well okay we thought you were off your rocker there for a minute but now that Saturday is restored itself we can continue but they build this Society where religious ideas are controlling the social atmosphere and the regulations for that town what do we call that again theocracy good yes they set up a theocracy however pretty soon people get curious about this community and they start listening to Joseph Smith and they go wow that guy's nuts he's off his rocker we need to do something about this people will start getting more and more vocal against Smith and his followers and pretty soon people start dealing with abuse should we leave maybe we should leave and submit the same I don't know what's right it out they just are angry because they're not ready for this well one night and the second in command in the church was a guy by the name of Brigham Young and bring them young stands up and says okay that's it we've seen where this is leading and we're all going to follow him to the Grave if we don't leave now and so they all said yep you're absolutely right they pick up from Illinois and they start moving West they follow the Oregon Trail up to a point and then they Branch off on a rather obscure branch that will actually lead one famous group of Western migratory peoples into serious disaster if you guys heard of the daughters Donner Party they were a group of settlers who took this cut off called Hastings cut off and went across the Great Salt Flats of Utah and tried to go up into California over the Sierra Nevada when they got up in the Sierras it started snowing and it snowed them in for months they couldn't get out of the get out of that area many of them resorted to cannibalism to stay alive yeah ouch so they were basically going on the same roof only thing is they didn't go all the way to California he got to the Great Salt Lake and Brigham Young said this is it this is where we're going to sit this is where we're going to establish ourselves and a lot of people said what are you nuts this is a terrible place to locate we're next to a lake that is salty he says yeah but there's other fresh water sources we'll be fine yeah it's going to be hard to arrange ourselves in this Hospital environment others who are with them will say no no we're not going with this we're heading on we're going to continue the journey on to California like there's other sane people who are on the other Trail and so a lot of them will migrate and they will send her into Northern California keep them in mind when we get to the consumerism part because I'm going to talk about this winter group that broke off from the main group and went to California they're going to play a role meanwhile if you take a look at Utah today the state of Utah what is the number one religious group that is practicing religion in Utah today Mormons religious group in Utah so their presence is still felt there this permanent establishment they made really took hold and it's continuing to take hold Generations are perpetuating this over time okay there's one more group I want to look at with a rather unusual leader and they're more friends I don't include this leader as one of the big leaders of the Great Awakening but at the same time they're interesting enough as a group to talk about the reason is they were led by a woman and that in and of itself is worthy to talk about the woman's name was Ann Lee and Lee had arrived at a fairly young age in America in 1774 right as the revolution is getting ready to happen so she was here at the birth of this new country of the Revolution and forward and she also had a religious experience in her life much like Joseph Smith did where she believed that she was there it's still kind of Fringe and hanging on but it's hard to perpetuate why is it hard to perpetuate well at the core of this personal purification that they have to go through is the concept of celibacy celibacy they need to withstand from having sex she says sex was necessary in order to perpetuate the species but it also brought out Humanities base your side it encouraged the evil to set in and if we really want to clean up our country and we want to prepare for the next coming this next holy world existence then we need to instead abstain from sex it will keep up here and so the men slept in their own dormitories and the women slept in their own dormitory like you said you saw that but when they conducted business of the of the community they all did it together as a group everybody was equal this was the most egalitarian you probably saw American get during this period of time egalitarian means equal Society the most equality that America has ever really had up to this point could be seen with the Shakers they lived in separate Spears yes but when they came together during the day they were equal the men and women all had an equal voice and while they might have different roles none of their roles were seen as subservient to the other the women were not subservient to the men they were just as important just as significant just as public they were all responsible ownership was communal they owned all the property community they realized that if their society was going to survive they needed a source of income from the outside world to get things that they couldn't make themselves so they got into making furniture and as a group they put up a type of furniture that became very well known it was solid very clean lines very well built good quality craftsmanship that was what it was known for and it became known as the shaker style today if you go to furniture stores you can still find the shaker style of furniture being made even if it's not being made by shakers the Shakers are basically more or less extinct there's still a few who are practicing it but it was hard to perpetuate their numbers and while they reach a peak of roughly 6,000 in that community after 1850 it started a severe plummet and decline until they more or less died out why did they go into decline celibacy there's the problem how are religions perpetuated kids kids learn from their parents and the parents indoctrinate their kids in their religious beliefs and the kids follow what their parents have taught them well if they stop having kids where's the next Generation going to come from they weren't believing there was going to be another generation and the second coming that Ann Lee had prophesied did not actually come to pass nonetheless she still fits into this unusual model of the Second Great Awakening were people are turning to religious ideas trying to fix what's wrong with Society she offers a different approach very different from some perspective but it is still religiously driven and it's impacted and influenced by a lot of the other movements that are going on they are affecting each other Society does not live in a vacuum much as they might like to it places even the Shakers could not live completely in a vacuum they still had to have some contact with the outside world because they couldn't get everything they needed so they needed that so even they who shunned the outside world and focused in on their own community they weren't able to keep it all out that is where I am going to cut off I told you we'd end a little early today so I'm going to Turn You Loose just about 10 minutes early have fun I'll see you on Wednesday</p>
