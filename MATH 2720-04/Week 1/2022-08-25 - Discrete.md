# Warm up
A high-performance computing cluster is controlled by two servers: compute and file, and the cluster cooling system consists of three units. The cluster admin recieved three diagnostic messages by email:
1. Bad file server, and the first cooling unit;
2. Bad compute server, and the second cooling unit;
3. File server is normal, but bad third cooling unit;

Only one server and no more than one cooling unit are bad
After repair it turned out that each message contained valid information either about the server's operation or about the cooling units' condition, but not simultaneously. Which server and which cooling units did the admin have to repair?
