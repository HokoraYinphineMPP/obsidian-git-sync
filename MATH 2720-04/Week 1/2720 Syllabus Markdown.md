by starting the first Edfinity Setup Assignment in the Start Here Module on Canvas.

## Textbook

Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction, (linkto html and pdf is on Canvas)
This textbook is free and open-source. The link is here:
[http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html)
##### PDF
![[Discrete Mathematics.pdf]]

We will cover Chapters 0-3 and Section 4.1 on Graph Theory.

## Course Description

From theBulletin of Courses: Introduction to thestudy and use of discrete
mathematical structures including number systems and bases, propositional logic,
sets, Boolean algebra, functions and relations, and induction. Additional topics may
include graph theory and asymptotic notation as time permits. May not be counted
toward fulfilling requirements in the mathematics major. Formerly Math 272;
students may not earn credit for both.

## Class Protocol

This is an asynchronous course.

## Assignments and Grading Policy

**Classroom Participation (15%)**

We will do group work every day and a group quiz on Thursdays.

**Learning Videos (15%)**

There are interactive learning videos in each Canvas Module. Completing them are a
required part of the course.

**Group Quizzes (15%)**


Every Thursday, in the last fifteen minutes of class, we will have a group quiz. The
group quiz will be based off the homework problems we worked on in class.

**Check Your Understanding (15%)**

Check Your Understanding Assignments are due every Friday by 11:59 pm. These
assignments will be submitted through the online homework platform _Edfinity_. You
are required to purchase a license for the semester. You can sign up by starting the
first Edfinity Setup Assignment in the Start Here Module.

**Portfolio (40%)**
Students will be required to create a portfolio in this course. The portfolio will
consist of your mathematics journal, worked problems, programming assignments,
and a course summary. You will submit a portfolio entry at the end of each chapter.
Details are available in the corresponding Module on Canvas. The final portfolio
entry is due Friday of finals week (at 11:59pm).

**Grading Scale**

A: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; D: 60-69; F: 59 and below


+/- grades may be given in the upper/lower ends of each grade range with the
exception of A+/F.

## University Policies and Campus Resources

**Dropping and Adding**
You are responsible for understanding the policies and procedures for add/drops,
withdrawal, etc. which can be also be found in the CSUSB Bulletin of Courses. See
[http://bulletin.csusb.edu/academic-regulations/](http://bulletin.csusb.edu/academic-regulations/)

**Academic Integrity**
Students are expected to be familiar with University policy on cheating and
plagiarism in ``Academic Regulations and Standards'' in the CSUSB Bulletin of
Courses. See:http://bulletin.csusb.edu/academic-regulations/

You may not consult any unauthorized source (such as internet websites or chats)
during oral quizzes. Homework solutions must be written in your own words and
components of solutions may not be copied word-for-word from any source.
Penalties for academic dishonesty on an assignment range from getting a zero grade
on that assignment, to getting a grade of **F** in thecourse. Incidents of suspected
academic dishonesty will be reported to the university. If any student suspects
academic dishonesty in the class, the student is encouraged to share these concerns
with me.

**Diversity Statement**
In our commitment to the furthering of knowledge and fulfilling our educational
mission, California State University, San Bernardino seeks a campus climate that
welcomes, celebrates, and promotes respect for the entire variety of human
experience. In our commitment to diversity, we welcome people from all
backgrounds and we seek to include knowledge and values from many cultures in
the curriculum, and extra-curricular life of the campus community. Dimensions of
diversity shall include, but are not limited to, the following: race, ethnicity, religious
belief, sexual orientation, sex/gender, disability, socioeconomic status, cultural
orientation, national origin, and age. (from the CSU San Bernardino University
Diversity Committee Statement of Commitment to Diversity, 1995)

**Support for Students with Disabilities**


In keeping with the university's Commitment to Diversity, the faculty of the College
of Natural Sciences fully supports the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Faculty
will provide reasonable accommodation to any student with a disability who is
registered with the Office of Services to Students with Disabilities and who needs
and requests accommodation. If you are in need of an accommodation for a
disability in order to participate in this class, please see the instructor and contact
Services to Students with Disabilities at UH-183, (909) 537-5238.

If you require assistance in the event of an emergency, you are advised to establish a
buddy system with a buddy and an alternate buddy in the class. Individuals with
disabilities should prepare for an emergency ahead of time by instructing a
classmate and the instructor.

**Emergency Management**
For information regarding campus emergency management and safety guidelines
see <https://www.csusb.edu/emergency-management>.

## Addendum

At some point in the class it may be necessary to make certain changes to the
syllabus to benefit students. Any changes will be announced via Canvas.

## Discussion of Academic Honesty

Using the internet or looking in the back of the book to find solutions can easily lead
to, perhaps unintentional, cases of plagiarism, otherwise known as ``cheating’’ or
``academic dishonesty’’. It may seem that you are learning how to do assigned
homework when you use the internet and/or book solutions; however, this practice
is very strongly discouraged since this approach often gives a false illusion of
learning.

Have faith in yourself. Some homework problems are intended to be challenging.
True learning occurs when you engage in a productive struggle with a problem and
discover how to make use of the problem-solving tools you have developed during
your studies. The only way to learn concepts deeply is to work thoughtfully and
engage your brain. Did you know that when we learn a new idea, an electric current
fires in our brains, crossing synapses and connecting different areas of the brain?
(From Jo Boaler – _Mathematical Mindsets_ .) You aregrowing your brain when you
struggle with new ideas.


If you choose to use content from an outside resource, it is imperative to give credit
in order to avoid a plagiarism offense. If you used the source extensively, the work
may not earn full credit, but this is better than the penalty for plagiarism. Note that
outside resources include the internet, tutors, and peers.

When acknowledging the use of a source, you should both cite the source and
indicate to what extent you used it. Here are some sample sentences:

```
● My ( classmate/parent/sibling/friend, include name )showed me how to do
this problem and my argument is very similar to theirs. I did try to write it in
my own words. I think I mostly understand the problem, but I may need more
review.
```
```
● I looked up the solution to this problem here: ( givelink or reference ).
Although I got an idea of how to do the problem from this source, I adapted
the method and rewrote in my own words. I feel I have a very strong
understanding of the structure of this problem.
```
```
● I looked up this result at the following website: ( copy link here ). This solution
is essentially the same as the one on the site because I couldn't figure out a
way to rewrite it differently. My understanding of this problem isn’t quite
solid yet.
```
(This portion of the syllabus has been adapted from work of Dr. McMurran and Dr.
Aikin.)
