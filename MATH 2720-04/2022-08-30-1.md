#### Q1
Dana says they have 10 toys
Milla says 8 toys
Milla stole at least 1 toy while dana is using 1 toy

Milla: 9-17
Dana: 1-9

#### Q2
###### if $C$ is the set of all students in our class today, is your group a subset or an element?

Subset

###### if $G$ is the set of all members of your group today, what are the elements of $G$?

Each person in our group

###### suppose $G$ is still the same set. how many subset of G are there?

possibly infinite, but currently none

###### What is $G\cap C$? $G\cup C$?
$\cap$ represents all elements in both G and C (intersect)
$\cup$ represents all elements that are in both G and C (union)

###### Find the following cardinalities
- $|A|$ when $A=\{6,7,8,9,...,29\}$
23 elements

- $|A|$ when $A=\{z\in Z|-4\leq z\leq 95 \}$
100 elements

- $|A\cap B|$ when $A=\{x\in N |x\leq 25\}$ and $B=\{z\in N|z$ is prime$\}$
9 elements

###### Find a set of smallest possible size that has both $\{1,3,5,6,10\}$ and $\{1,2,6,8,10\}$ as subsets.
$\{1,2,3,5,6,8,10\}$

###### Let $A=\{0,3,7,8,15\}$ and $B=\{3,7,15\}$. How many sets $C$ satisfy $C\subseteq A$ and $B\subseteq C$?
