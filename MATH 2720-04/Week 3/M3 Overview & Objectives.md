This week you will learn about sets and functions. Sets are the mathematical notion of a collection of things and as such they are the most fundamental objects of mathematics. We will also start learning about functions in a more abstract framework than those you have encountered in calculus.

**Module Objective(s):** The module objectives listed below support and align with the stated Course Outcomes (CO), are measurable, and clearly describe what you will learn and be able to do upon successful completion of this module. By the end of this module you will be able to:

-   **MO1**. Understand the definition of a function including domain, codomain, image, range, and ways of defining functions. (CO1)
-   **MO2**. Compute outputs of recursively defined functions. (CO1)
-   **MO3**. Determine if a function satisfies the definitions of injection, surjection, and bijection. (CO1)

**Agenda:** The purpose of the instructional materials included in this module is to reinforce learning of the content that supports the stated objectives and are to be used to help you complete the learning activities. Below is a list of instructional materials, activities, and assessments that will help you achieve the learning objectives for this module.

-   Watch the learning videos in this module
-   Read Section 0.4: Functions
-   Complete the Check Your Understanding Questions with Edfinity.
-   Review Module Wrap Up

**Grades and Evaluating Criteria:** Refer to syllabus.
