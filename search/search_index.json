After obtaining the desired action and account, your program should make a function call to one of the following functions:</p> <p><code>void print_balance(string account);</code>     - Prints the user\u2019s account balance, where string parameter account is equal to \u201cS\u201d if they wish to see their savings balance, \u201cC\u201d if they wish to see their checking balance, or \u201cB\u201d to see both balances.</p> <p><code>void deposit(string account);</code>     - Prompts the user for the amount they wish to deposit into the desired account. The string parameter account is equal to \u201cS\u201d if they wish to deposit into their savings, or \u201cC\u201d if they wish to deposit into their checking.     - After depositing the amount, this function calls print_balance() to show their account\u2019s new balance.</p> <p><code>void withdraw(string account);</code>     - Prompts the user for the amount they wish to withdraw from the desired account. The string parameter account is equal to \u201cS\u201d if they wish to withdraw from their savings, or \u201cC\u201d if they wish to withdraw from their checking.     - The function checks if the amount is valid (if it is less than or equal to what they have in their account).         - If it is valid, then the function withdraws the amount and calls print_balance() to show their account\u2019s new balance.         - If the withdrawal is not valid, then the function deducts a $3.00 penalty fee from their account, displays a message relaying the deduction, and calls print_balance() to print their account\u2019s new balance.</p> <p>Once the user has selected to quit, display the final balances for both accounts.</p> <p>Declare global variables to represent your user\u2019s savings and checking balances.

Students come to work on writing projects for\u00a0a wide variety of courses across the university. Our writing consultants are graduate and undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines.</p> <p>Writing consultants work with writers at all stages of the composing process, helping to interpret assignments, discover topics, expand ideas, clarify organization, incorporate counter-arguments, cite references, edit, and proofread. Several consultants work specifically with multilingual writers to help them negotiate linguistic and cultural differences in written composition; these consultants also conduct informal English conversation groups for multilingual speakers. Writing Center staff work with faculty members who are designing and evaluating writing components of their courses, in addition to conducting writing workshops in those faculty members' classrooms, and reading and responding to manuscripts in preparation.</p> <p>In all situations, Writing Center staff write with writers, never for\u00a0them. They work to preserve the integrity of writers' ideas and plans, even as they challenge writers to interrogate and contextualize both their own and others ideas, language, and sources.</p> <p>You can visit us in CE 310, peruse our website, connect with us via Zoom, or\u00a0email us at\u00a0WritingCenter@csusb.edu\u00a0for more information.</p>"},{"location":"2022%20Fall/MATH%202210-12/Math%202210-12/","title":"Math 2210 12","text":""},{"location":"2022%20Fall/MATH%202210-12/Math%202210-12/#zr-points-log","title":"ZR Points Log","text":"<p>ZR</p>"},{"location":"2022%20Fall/MATH%202210-12/Math%202210-12/#week-1","title":"Week 1","text":"<p>2022-08-23 2022-08-25 -

It may seem that you are learning how to do assigned homework when you use the internet and/or book solutions; however, this practice is very strongly discouraged since this approach often gives a false illusion of learning.</p> <p>Have faith in yourself. Some homework problems are intended to be challenging. True learning occurs when you engage in a productive struggle with a problem and discover how to make use of the problem-solving tools you have developed during your studies. The only way to learn concepts deeply is to work thoughtfully and engage your brain. Did you know that when we learn a new idea, an electric current fires in our brains, crossing synapses and connecting different areas of the brain? (From Jo Boaler \u2013 Mathematical Mindsets .) You aregrowing your brain when you struggle with new ideas.</p> <p>If you choose to use content from an outside resource, it is imperative to give credit in order to avoid a plagiarism offense. If you used the source extensively, the work may not earn full credit, but this is better than the penalty for plagiarism. Note that outside resources include the internet, tutors, and peers.</p> <p>When acknowledging the use of a source, you should both cite the source and indicate to what extent you used it. Here are some sample sentences:</p> <pre><code>\u25cf My ( classmate/parent/sibling/friend, include name )showed me how to do\nthis problem and my argument is very similar to theirs. I did try to write it in\nmy own words. I think I mostly understand the problem, but I may need more\nreview.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>\u25cf I looked up the solution to this problem here: ( givelink or reference ).\nAlthough I got an idea of how to do the problem from this source, I adapted\nthe method and rewrote in my own words. I feel I have a very strong\nunderstanding of the structure of this problem.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>\u25cf I looked up this result at the following website: ( copy link here ). This solution\nis essentially the same as the one on the site because I couldn't figure out a\nway to rewrite it differently.

which section it is and the date today is 24th okay so coming down home stretch 3 weeks left three weeks we've been talking about consumerism as it's approaching more of a modern approach and the automotive and cigarette Industries in that early 20th century did start changing things to fit but where the real water shed the real change of direction is where it really turns into Modern Advertising is World War I I changes everything World War II adopted a lot of production and marketing strategies that will forever change American consumers during the war they adopted a program that they tried in World War 1 and fail it's a concept called total war total war what is that mean basically it means that the government takes a direct control over the entire US economy and they tried to get everybody in the nation involved in the war effort in one way or another so that everyone is focused on the war accomplishing the goals World War one was an unpopular War America didn't want to get into it anymore they wanted to sit it out America wanted to remain isolationists however they understood the reasons they were getting in and grudgingly went along with it but at the same time they were never really popular about this war they the war was not popular world different why was World War II different than World War 1 Pearl Harbor because they were attacked it started with that attack on Pearl Harbor and that was an incredible motivator to get people focused on the war so all of a sudden this war is very different the other one they had to convince people well we really do need to go out and do it people kind of drag their feet some people joined up real quick you know but otherwise they weren't doing a very good job recruiting people and getting hearts and Minds in line with that and Total War will work much better in World War II so what exactly is involved in Total War well for one thing the government tells corporations openly what they will make not what they want to buy from them but it directs them it orders them to make certain things now is that technically constitutional no that's a violation of the Commerce Clause even during a time of war that technically is still crossing the line however when the government comes to companies like General Motors or Chrysler it says you're not making cars anymore until this war is over nope and they take a look at it and go well it is after all our Patriots they have confirmed buyers here guaranteed purchase it and the government is not cheating them they're paying them a good surprise okay so in addition to that you have companies like General Electric light bulb manufacturer right they're not making light bulbs they're making bomb fees can we get down on the traffic please thank you so how do they sell this idea how do they keep people focused how do they make people stay War Center convince people that it is their patriotic duty to commit everything to this war whether it's their lives or their livelihood or buying war bonds to help support the financial efforts how do they do it the answer propaganda now we already talked about the influence of Hitler in FDR's propaganda well this is where it kicks into high gear Hitler really gives them a road map on how to use it properly he is using propaganda in a masterful way he's using it for evil intense but he's good at it okay his people are good at it and the United States learns their lessons they learn how to sell ideas to the people to keep them focused you know what their tool of choices paranoia you have to always be on guard despiser Among Us if you ever vigilant if you live on the coast maintain good light discipline keep those curtains closed at night you don't want those enemies of Marines seeing where things are these are all sorts of different ways now was there really a risk with the Enemy submarines seeing light on the shore no but the whole point here is it creates this this atmosphere of paranoia against the enemy we have to stay focused we have to stay vigilant this is a war and the whole idea is you're doing your part you close your drapes you're helping the war effort you've maintain life discipline you are actively supporting America's War even if it's just covering your window also think about this so many people signed up immediately and went to the service World War one we had a fairly good volunteer rate World War 2 it was astronomical huge okay so paranoia becomes their weapon of choice this is where they learn a very important lesson and it's a lesson that the government still knows and uses on a regular basis so learn it if you want to get people to do what you want as a government you need a boogie man you need a bad guy because with a common Unified effort against a bad guy you can create National Unity this country was never more unified than on two particular days which arguably could be seen as the two periods of American History where the country was more united than it has ever been before at least since the revolution day one hey knock it off you want to talk go outside and talk you don't have to be here okay so how do they do it the boogie man you get somebody something to be afraid of and it creates Unity so what are those two big days December 8th 1941 the day after Pearl Harbor that day had more National Unity than ever before everybody was 100% on board the other day September 12th 2001 day after 9/11 Bush's approval rating even that early and understand he is only been in office for basically half a year his approval rating was down around 42% so people weren't really thinking he was doing too great a job to begin with the day after unfortunately he wasn't able to maintain it he went out with an approval rating down around 18% out that's when he left office so you can see the swing of public approval when something happens that the country is attacked and they respond in kind Pearl Harbor and 9/11 both are good examples of that so paranoia can be used to create a national Unity that is very helpful when you're trying to push concept like total war so all of these people are signing up for the war ever men and even a lot of women are getting in uniform at this point keep in mind that women going into combat wasn't common but at this point the military is recruiting women for for Army Services specially and they are using them for the administrative jobs back in Washington while the men are going out to combat so that's one way that they're able to pick up the slack there however all those able-bodied men they're from the Farms they're from the factories and now they're fighting a war overseas well what happens there's now a work shortage isn't it so we got to fill those gaps how do we deal with things like agriculture who grows the crops we've got a time of War so we need agricultural production more than ever but we don't have the farmers to grow it most able-bodied men just went overseas so how do you do it well during the Great Depression we spent basically the entire decade deporting Mexican immigrants who are working in the Central Valley because we were trying to make room for the Okies and other people who had migrated into California to have jobs so that they didn't have to compete against immigrant labor from Mexico so we were deporting them 10 years and we did not have a very good reputation with them and then in early World War II we went back down there and said how would you guys like to come back they started actively recruiting people from Mexico to come up and fill the labor Gap it became known as The Bracero Program The Bracero Program brought them in and did a lot of things that people have been resisting all that time and frankly still do minimum wage good living conditions Healthcare all those things were guaranteed to them by the federal government if they agreed to come up at this particular point in the time of War they got a lot of people who responded the bra serial program was actually very successful and it took care of probably 2/3 of the labor problem that they had to fill so it was a good stop Gap we made it work but also they encourage people to do something they tried in World War 1 to limit it success but it was far more successful in World War Two the encouraged everybody at home if you had a backyard to start a victory garden victory garden if you want to win this war we need to be able to feed the troops which means we're going to have some shortages so you can help out on a personal level if you can grow at least some of your food so they encourage people to start a vegetable garden in their backyard to help alleviate some of those problems and it actually had a dent but more than that it made people feel like they were part of the success he gave them a sense of patriotism a sense of nationalism they were contributing however limited it might have been everyone had an opportunity in one way or another to feel like they were part of it that they had a personal stake in it so National Unity was a big deal now after the war is over oh I haven't dealt with another big shortage the shortage in the industry how do they deal with shortages in the factories in the shipyards in the airplane manufacturing plants if they're going to have to have huge amounts of production out how do they deal with the shortages there they're not recruiting immigrants who do they recruit for that women they were group women for the first time in American history women are being openly encouraged only we're going to men not just industrial jobs women have had industrial work before but it's usually very detailed work technical work but not particularly physically taxing they don't have to do a lot of heavy lifting all of that changes they need women to do the big heavy industrial jobs they need them to become welders in the shipyard they need them to use the rivet guns in the air screen in the aircraft Factory in the shipyards as well so they need them to do these heavy labor jobs that only went to men up to this point and this is where they get one of the most successful propaganda campaigns in history the Rosie the Riveter campaign now most of you have probably seen Rosie the river she's woman dressed in red white and blue with a yellow background danger we're at a time of war and it says we can do it and she's sitting there with a muscle showing that she's strong now this was highly effective because all the sudden the women realize it was their patriotic duty to get out of the house and get into the factories and go to work and what's more is it blurred color lines they weren't just recruiting white women they were recruiting all women and so there's a lot of pictures coming out of this period where you see black women and white women working together in the same factories completely cooperate and then it's working so this is also one of those hitches that is starting to show the cracks in breakdown of civil rights and white white supremacy we're going to see the rise of the civil rights of the good comes out of World War II this is where some of those cracks started started to appear in the factories as these women are working side by side they picked up the slack and they did the job okay World War II was unique and so many ways so very many ways every single war in American history to date including Afghanistan has had a big downturn after the war is over economically when the war ends less money is being thrown into the economy by the government production slows and the economy takes a debt sometimes it's more drastic than others World War II however a lot of people were scared about that reason being World War II pulled America out of the depression and the last thing anybody wanted after five good years of prosperity during the war the war was great for the economy and people at home were living large nobody wanted to go back to the depression and it was one of the big driving forces of the government to make sure that after World War II happened that the economy would keep going so they came up with a program to make sure it did World War I want a World War 2 excuse me is the only war in American history where the economy actually continued to get better rather than taking every other War the economy tanks that made World War II distinctive and yet another way so how do they do it up to this point the American dream has been a somewhat vague concept it's an idea tied to opportunity and hard work and then you can make something of yourself and go after that American Dream It's all about America being the land of opportunity but at this point in time the American dream takes Focus it becomes a lot more specific it takes form you can see it you can smell it you can taste it you know what the American dream is and I would bet that everybody in here well at least the vast majority of people in here would know exactly what that is okay so let's try something everybody close your eyes and try not to go before okay visualize the American dream in your mind see it as a picture paint it see it's colors see it's form look at what's there and who's involved okay now open your eyes what did you see yeah my family a family okay how many a lot okay some people will see a really big family lots of kids but typically during this period of time this is where we get a new model for America what is the standard two kids boy and a girl keeps it out of confusion everybody's involved in the American dream boys and girls alike okay where do they live Suburban this is a Suburban dream okay problem is a lot of the cities have not yet built suburbs a lot of them are still very much Urban huh come back to that what else do you see what color is the house describe it to me does your house have a color or did you just see a wood house there paint it what color is it white it's usually a White House in the American dream for some reason I don't know why but I've had people say other colors before but white typically is the one that's most of do you have just Concrete in the front of the house what do they have big lawn right what's on the lawn couple kids playing Maybe what are they playing with a football yeah they might be throwing a football around what else are they playing with what jump rope okay dog yes what kind of a dog Golden Retriever a big happy floppy dog he's having fun his comes wagging all over the place jumping around and racing around with the kids right no rat dogs allowed it's got to be a big happy fluffy dog and cats use you with all sorts of evil they're conniving their slide cats are on American dogs dogs big happy fluffy dogs golden retrievers Irish Setters something big and happy and affection okay husband when he comes out of the door to go to work how's he dressed Suit &amp; Tie White Collar white color what does that mean in order to get a white collar job what do you have to have first an education they're pushing College they haven't pushed colleges part of the American dream before now they start and there's a reason for that okay so he's dressed what does Mom do does Mom go off to work too mom stays home and watches the kids she's a housewife in other words ladies thank you for your service now get your butts out of the factory so we can get the men back to work go home and raise kids the problem is a lot of women liked working a lot of women don't really see that domestic dream as something that they really want or maybe they don't want it right now maybe later but they like having their time be productive to do something that they consider valuable and constructive they like that no Are there women who are perfectly happy in fact Overjoyed with getting back in the family raising kids in the house doing the domestic things absolute there are women who thrive on that and more power to him but what about the women who want to work this is where the government has to come up with a new propaganda campaign Rosie the Riveter will become friends now up to this point in time secretaries typically were male in business but all of that changes after World War II the new stereotype they put out there is a mailbox and a female secretary that becomes the new standard women are encouraged to learn how to type to take dictation with you know being a doing short-hand and stuff like that be very organized and and whatnot this is what they're encouraged to do but notice it's still a subservient role men are the important ones women are serving them helping them to succeed help me kind of mug what there is now a path to legitimate recognized employment this is something that women are not stigmatized you can be a middle class woman who goes to work if she wants to she doesn't have to but you can and it's no longer socially ground upon it's just she wants to be active this is giving rise to the women's movement that's coming the big activism of women in the '60s and '70s has its roots with Rosie the Riveter and the discontent after they get out of their job and be told go back into the home start punching out kids producing please okay so the posterior American Dream what is it really what does all of this mean for the people all of a sudden you have an ideal of what it means to be a good patriotic nationalistic American you go get a job preferably White Collar but get a job get married have kids buy a house buying a house fuels construction that creates jobs also once you buy the house what do you what else do you have to buy exactly you have to put you have to buy all the stuff that you stick in the house whether it's furniture or appliances a new vacuum for the long wall carpet whatever and then when you open up the refrigerator for the American dream it's completely packed full of food right no empty refrigerators in the Americans tons of food lots of variety so here people are saying I don't want to have steak today I think I'll have to whereas back in the depression they're going I wonder when we're going to eat next big change and people are seeing the American dream actually being something within reach and it is that's the best part of it it is Within Reach at least if some people okay why the push they need to convince Americans to keep spending money the big problem of the 1930s is that they lost their confidence in the system and so instead of spending money actively like the ordinarily would when you spend money what does that do you buy something a company does better they sell enough stuff they start hiring more people that means more jobs and those people are making money and they're spending more of it and that creates more jobs and the economy gets better well you get that feeling of how everything is kind of spinning up and the more it works the better everybody does well what happens when everybody says I might need that money for a rainy day and if I send it now I can be like those people out on the street who don't have homes so instead of spending their money really like they were before instead of consuming they take their money and they stick it in the mattress they're putting a little cubby hole they stash it they don't put it in the bank because the banks are folding thanks system was going under in the 30s that was a long hard road to recovery but then even after they fixed the bank and convince people okay you can start putting your money back in they're still not spending it they're concerning it they're being very very frugal and stingy on how they spend their money even when they have it and they're in lies the real problem when you don't spend money the company can't sell products the company can't sell products they laid people off that means fewer people are making money and suddenly more companies are losing money more companies are laying off and that creates a downward spiral it just Cascades on itself that's how the depression became so bad it just was one thing after another collapsing World War II speaks to avoid this in the aftermath the US government will use the American dream deliberately to prevent that from happening to keep people spending keep their confidence eyes hey things are great things are stable they're working now and they sell them on that and America bison Hook Line Anderson one to two cars after all car for Dad car for mom mom needs a cartoon why well the automotive industry wants you to buy two instead of one that's double the sale makes sense right you can convince people hey your wife needs a car too yeah you're right one to two kids kids all of you are moving toward that direction of having kids some of you might even have them already let me tell you something people I hope your finances are in place because kids are pricey you got to spend money on them diapers cost money cleaning stuff cost money the stuff they destroy has to be replaced all of that and you have to buy a new clothes every 3 to 6 months because they're growing so fast it's expensive to raise kids and for consumerism that's great have kids lots of kids because you have to spend money on simulation economy also this whole idea of being a homeowner being somebody who's possesses the American dream you're a homeowner a lot of these homes haven't been built yet this is creating a construction industry like America has never seen before they build those suburbs All Over America within just a few years construction jobs are good for decades it's not until the 70s where the construction industry kind of falls down a little bit when we have another reception there but for years and years the construction industry is booming if you get into Construction in the 40s you're going to retire well you can make a really really good living so buy your own home in order to make this happen they also Target veterans in a number of things first of all one big problem afterwards is when the veterans all come back there's not enough jobs for them all so there were returning to an economy that slowing down and suddenly they're saying I spend all my time over there sacrificing and gave up a good job and what am I getting out of it unemployment that sucks you don't have that why because of a couple key things first ball they were creating jobs for the blue collar workers who weren't really all that enamored was going to call it there's the bookish kind of people who want to go to college and there's people who aren't people like being outside and working with their hands they're physical people go to the construction industry tons of jobs the other people how do you get them into college well this is where the government was truly these they came up with something called the GI Bill of Rights after people start coming home they're giving this piece of paper as they're being discharged for serving in the war hey thanks for your service now let me show you what you're going to get as a reward for helping your country out at the time of service we respect what you did we value what you did and we want you to benefit from me so they give them the GI Bill of Rights one thing the GI bill is most known for is what anyone you guys know what the GI Bill does okay if you get into the service and you stay in for x amount of time they will pay some if not all of your college one tour of Duty will pay for roughly half you do two tours which a lot of these people back everybody qualifies if you are wartime because it's double crap when you are in war it's like you're serving twice that amount when it comes to the GI bill so as all of these guys are coming out they're saying wait a minute are you saying that don't pay my entire college education for free yep all you got to do is qualify and go the American dream suddenly is in viewport but what else does it do all those people who are getting out of the service and then instead of going to work they're going to college no unemployment numbers these people are instead going to college and what are they going to college for science technology engineering and math stem this is where the US starts really emphasizing stem approach you heard from before this is a big thing with kids trying to get the kids who are more scientifically minded get him acted early and start developing it early here to focus on science Technology and Engineering well America knows that if that it's positioned in the world right now is because it is militarily strong coming out of a war going in they were weak coming out they are the strongest power on the planet with the possible exception of the Soviet Union now that being the case they want to stay on top that means they're going to have to develop new technology over time new types of aircraft are coming out Germany was coming out with Jeff before the end of the war America war books on yet so he's Union will focus on Jets and they will continually be pushing each other for better and better test Rockets Germany had the best rocket scientists in the world us got roughly half of them so many Union took the other half we had Nazis running our rocketry program and we basically said well they're not really Nazis and so we kept them out of the Nuremberg stuff but the truth is yeah they were burner Von Braun was a member of the Nazi party we didn't put him on trial for Nazis stuff because we needed him to run our rocket program he was argue please in the world we needed that if you think rockets by the way we're about going to the Moon they weren't the Rockets before Delivery Systems for nuclear weapons that's what we want in rocket technology for we covered it with other things and you know we found good use for Rockets along the way but satellites up sending people in the International Space Station putting people on the moon we've done all that but it was really about developing this technology okay another thing that happens when the veterans come home you've been overseas for four years fighting the enemy maybe you were in Europe maybe you were in the Pacific but wherever you were you have not spent any money you've been out in the field you've been carrying a rifle you've been flying places you've been doing more stuff you haven't been spending money you've been sleeping on the ground sleeping on a cot sleeping in a tent whatever you get home and you're out processing the first thing they do is say okay here's all your back pain and they hand you a stack of cash like this and you're going wow I wonder what I could spend this money on well funny thing about that GI bill of right here you know you talked about college you are really interested in college but there is something you might be interested in and some people love the idea of college but there is something else in the GI Bill of Rights that was very the Veterans Administration Loan program otherwise known as a VA loan a VA loan allows somebody who is in the service or is a veteran of the service to get a loan where the entire cost of the house including the closing costs is wrapped up in the loan you don't have to pay any money as a down payment at all no money at a pocket all you need is a good job I can do that get a job buy a house and you know that big stack of cash that's burning a hole in their pocket well now they got something to spend it on furniture appliances stuff for inside the house so there's spending it and going after that American dream and the GI Bill and Powers them to do it so the soldiers are really being taken care of but what about the civilians well they are too housing values were a little bit sketchy they weren't quite sure how much property was really worth and the Foreclosure rate for really high so Banks didn't really want to loan money during this period if they should program did not take off but after World War 2 the FHA program which allows people to buy a house not for no money down before a relatively minimal down payment only about 3% you come in with 3% of the purchase price and most people were used to coming in with 20 at that point you had to put 20% down before they give you a loan well now 3% all of a sudden a whole lot more people can buy buy home and so home sales really Skyrock and so as these suburbs are building up and up and up people are buying up those houses before they're even finished they're ready to move in now something about the American dream when you envision the people who are coming out of that house Dad Mom the kids Foot Race on it the American dream is a white dream does that mean the minorities can not take part in the street no they can't they just have a few more hurdles jump over the hurdles have been cleared away for the white people they got a straight line to the American dream the line that minorities have to take is a little bit more difficult but still achievable one thing where you start seeing some institutionalized racism come out is with the FHA program now we talked a bit about the FHA program back when we were talking about race but let's go over again FHA in order to get the best rates they had ABC and D Loans the best interest rates the lowest interest rates were for the alums that means you can get your payment as low as possible and buy as much house as you can and because of that FHA said well they grade the homes based on the neighborhood they're in and the qualifications of the bike so the buyer has to meet certain Financial things that crosses glass down doesn't it you can be African American and be making plenty enough money to buy a house not a problem you can have a good credit however they also grade the neighborhood based on the residents and this is where the racism comes in yep even one minority moves in on a block especially if it's an African American that is enough to immediately downgrade the entire neighborhood from A to B even if the homes are brand new suddenly it makes the neighborhood less desirable and so they're not willing to get the same interest rate it brings the home value down you see how this is an institutionalized racist racism thing is a lot of people even people who say you know I don't really like what's going on but I got to protect the home values of myself and the other so when they buy a house they have to sign a contract to purchase contract that says if you buy this house then you are agreeing when you sell the house later that you only sell it to a white family that process became known as Blockbuster the whole idea here is if you can sell only to white people that keeps the neighborhood values up and so there will be a lot of resistance in selling homes to African Americans unless the entire neighborhood is committing to being minority that's the only way they'll do it and then everybody's automatically in the beat category anyway okay so eventually this will go through the courts and the courts will say this is unconstitutional get rid of this provision and FHA will get rid of any kind of racialized neighborhood rating for and they will simply do it on a house by house based on its construction and its condition what takes the race out of it but or the 40s and 50s that was very much in play there really wasn't until the early 60s before that starts getting heavily challenged yeah yeah you can call it redlining and it's also called white flight because whatever what else happens here is the whites really everybody lived together in the Inner City they have their different neighborhood but they were all in the urban center and when the lights start moving up to the suburb into the resistance being able to buy out there the white move out in force leaving all the minorities back into town now what's the effect of that all the minorities are there but who controls the city government the minorities whites do and so all of a sudden things like fixing the potholes placing the street lights mowing the lawn of the local park all of those things that were expected by the whites now start sliding to the crap well we don't really have money to put the street repair work we're worried about our police forces right now so they build up the police forces and things like going in the potholes gets pushed out three four five years and then replacing burnt out street lights half of them might be burned out before they start replacing any of them that becomes a real problem this gives rise to Urban Decay and this neglected is a reflection of a racist mind this is something that is an after effect called also in a lot of cities even places where segregation isn't really the law of the land that's common down in the South but what about in places like New York Los Angeles Chicago this deal with LA because you guys are familiar with LA it's close right if you go into East LA you're going to see a neighborhood that is predominately Mexican you go into South Central Los Angeles you're going to see a neighborhood that it's predominantly African American you go into an area of North Central Los Angeles downtown and you're going to move into Little Tokyo you go out into the wheel shot the Wilshire and Fairfax District and you're going to see Koreatown you go up into the La Brea area and you're going to see the Jewish Enclave in other words this creates ghettoization and it's not just Los Angeles this happens it happens in all the major cities where these policies are in place because whites are moving out of the city all of a sudden new ones start encouraging people from certain races to congregate there self segregation starts to happen and part of it is government manipulation they are manipulating it for instance okay the Urban Decay and the higher minority jobless rates compared to White to have virtually no unemployment at all by the 1960s the unemployment rate in South Central Los Angeles after the closure of all the wartime plants will go up as high as 25% when whites are having unemployment rate of about two and a half percent he's the difference this is what leads to the Watts Riots the Urban Decay The Rising presence of police the incredible rise of police brutality the increasing poverty in those neighborhoods is leading to more and more racial tensions that are starting to really act out that will lead them Civil Rights Movement is healing okay so that's the American dream now let's come back to the idea of the boogie even before the end of the war before the war was over they knew that they're aligned to be anywhere it's a lions of convenience only they don't have the same ideas ideologies they don't share the same vision communism versus capitalism that's going to be a big key and the American dream is a capitalist stream the American wants its economy to keep going the last thing they want is a bunch of commies coming in telling them how to change everything and how this isn't going to work they don't want a counter message to the one that they're selling keep that in mind before the war was ever over the United States was already engaging in something that will become known as atomic diplomacy why do we drop the atomic bombs on Japan some people say well it's so that we can save soldiers live the invasions were costly okay the invasions were costly but the truth is we didn't have to invade Japan at the Potsdam Conference that last big Conference of the big three Britain the United States and Soviet Union they were making plans for how they were going to attack Japan well at that conference Because cousin of Hirohito the emperor of Japan attended he was a prince in the royal family and a trusted Confidant of the emperor and he's also outside of the political system he's a royal he came to Potsdam and was requesting repeatedly and audience was Truman so that he can start negotiating the end of the war they were coming to the peace table they were out of supplies they were out of people and Tokyo had been getting Fireball det29 were just peppering Fireball they were dropping Napalm all over why the terrorize them killed over 300,000 people in the in the fire bombing of Tokyo believe it or not more people died in the fireballing then died in the atomic explosion at either of those other things that combined so do we really have to drop off you droppedia okay some people can say well yeah we had to drop on her ocean but we needed to show them we were going to be in charge of negotiation so some people can justify Hiroshima but the Japanese were coming to the table and asking for negotiations 3 days later we dropped on Nagasaki did we need to what was the message wasn't meant for Japan what are the atomic bombs really meant for Japan no this was a communication with the Soviet Union saying don't process but there are also other political things involved for one thing the Manhattan Project that was the project to develop nuclear weapons during World War 2 and it cost fully 110th of the entire War budget just to develop nuclear 110th of all of the war by just the World War 2 that was a massively expensive water so that can show you just how much money you spend on them well if they hadn't dropped a nuclear weapon or two on after war is over and they start doing the accounting and they're saying you paid how much for this program what did we get out of it where did that money go and people would be held accountable now they have not one but two very visible demonstrations of what that money went for big big super box which by today's standard would be tiny in the world those moms would be called small tactical levels I give you an idea how big the bottom car now okay so we needed a reason to justify the Manhattan Project but still one bomb would have done that what is coupons prove them we have more than one and this can just keep on going if you drop one and then drop two the implication is we've got a whole bunch more and if you want to keep going with this we'll keep cranking them out truth is Nagasaki was our last song we didn't have anymore after that now we will eventually develop but we were out of bomb stuff we had enough to make three tests and the two that we brought that's it but the implications yeah the Nagasaki bomb well it's not that they were afraid of it pre-driggering so the trigger had to be put into place in Flight the real danger there though was that there were a couple really technical things and you know airplanes move around a bit but if you touch one part to another part they could actually cause the thing to start it's critical mass and basically debate the bomb on its weight Target and so this guy was the head nuclear engineer was the one doing all of this and when he got done his hands were suffering frostbite because it's so cold but he couldn't wear gloves because he needed to and he has scraped himself and cut himself all up afterward his hands off bloody and everything and he's got bandages wrapped around all his fingers but he got the thing in he did it right but yeah it was it did have to go through a final assembly on the group thing because they didn't want it to detention center yeah yeah that was changed the other thing is they wanted to make sure that there was no cracks on takeoff and that was the other thing when b29 crashed it was typically on Facebook that's what they have their most problems so if they could get off the ground then it was safe to start putting bomb here that's what they did okay following World War 2 tensions between Soviet Union the United States continue to ramp up the Soviet Union was not leaving Eastern Europe there were basically absorbing and they were starting to expand we had a showdown over Germany they control the eastern half the Western Powers led by the United States controller but Berlin is in the eastern end and the Soviet Union wanted Berlin the capital completely in their hands and they tried to blockade it the United States however had a treaty with them that no access to it and so well it's so heating cut off the railroad the United States who planes in and dared the Soviet Union if you shoot him down they kept us up for over a year to supply the city by air is one of the most incredible airlift operations in the history maybe name of Two Brothers operation Berlin Airlift Rose because the Soviet Union clearly was showing themselves between the bad guy trying to starve out of city like that is not a sign that you're working in their best thing and then Soviet Union will respond by invading Slovakia in 1947 the United States showed its pleasure by staging a nuclear weapons affects test in the south Mississippi basically they took all of our obsolete Navy ships from World War 2 and the entire Imperial Japanese maybe Fleet and put them all at anger at the Indian bowl and then they proceeded to Rock 2 because one right after another now do they know that the weapons work of course both of them are Nagasaki style box same design but we're testing out what will happen if this s*** get hit with them what will happen to the shift come on it doesn't take a rocket science or a nuclear site that if the nuclear weapon goes off in the Sleep everybody dies are still going to die nobody lives what is the real purpose of that they're showing this their displeasure of what the Soviet Union is doing and it is over threat you keep this up you're going to be next all of that will last until something changes in 1949 there are a lot changes in the world their first nuclear weather all of a sudden we aren't the only ones who got now the Soviets got them too and this turns into an exchange of atomic diplomacy on both side they should off West we should off weapons they shoot off weapons we shoot up figure weapons viet union pay son weapon in the Euros you may get time that is the biggest weapon that's ever been detonated on the planet and that area of the Ural Mountains where that weapon went off it's still hot today still very radioactive there is the transition Highway and in the area where they come even remotely close to the the place they're still for the next 50 miles drive as fast as you can it tells you to floor your Noble was the biggest radioactive accident basically a nuclear plant in what is taking cream so he needed to find had a full meltdown not just the radiation leak but they're entire core went Radioactive in a blew up Chernobyl is now so Radioactive that you can't really go there for any length of time now over the years they've been able to contain a lot of the radiation and they've created this big super structure over where the bomb went off to help keep the surrounding area less radioactive so you can go out there and work for a stretch of time but you can't live there period And it continues to a radiate the Volga River which feeds the city of PF birth defection cancer rate Skyrocket into Ukraine because of that your Nobles OK Google I mean we had to spend a huge amounts of money so obvious weren't put together a bigger program not like that not like we did we're going okay that weapon sure looked a lot like Nagasaki last is identical yield is identical I wonder where they got that information let me think bye they know it they knew they had spies some Manhattan Project so they started doing the Spy hunt and eventually they came up with who delivered through the material lover they know that two scientists had passed on information one of them might kept secret because they didn't want to reveal how they found out about truth is we were reading the Russians coded mail and we didn't want the Russians know that we had broken that post because that was prompt them to change it we got to break that one too so we didn't reveal the name of one of them but we let take care of the other ones and the British scientist pop students they put them on Trials into sent prison for 9 years however the person who let the people who actually passed on the secret to the Soviets was a little Eastern European couple Russians this is convenient to the dialogue time who were passing on secrets too the Soviet Union and their names now for a long time people thought that Julia's been Ethel Rosenberg were simply Patsy that they were set up by the government and yeah when the Soviet Union collapsed we got into some of the kgbt files they opened them up for us they did it they really were the ones who gave up well they were put on trial for Espionage during a time of War they were found guilty and they were executed but involvement and the fact that Soviet Union was stealing weapons that played into the hole would be man concept we've got the Boogeyman in that game after the buggy man in this country wow if they invaded the Manhattan Project nothing is here we need to get rid of the Communist in this country let's get rid of them all so they go on the second major red scarf in America the biggest one different things from McCarthy Cara McCarthyism does anybody know who they were going after did they go after the leaders of the Communist part nope did they go after union leaders like they did in World War One no but they go out what's that that they were added on later but that's not who they went after it who are they going to not exactly here it is it went after Hollywood understand what they've learned in their time in the last 20 years propaganda the power they're not trying to kill the Messenger they're trying to kill the message they don't care about the Communist Party in America they care about it publicity propaganda is what they want to control and so they Target Hollywood they want to kill the message now during this period of time it is a joint House and Senate Congressional hunt okay you have Senator McCarthy who's leading the whole thing but the house on American activities is really the one that's running the thrive and among those things that they're doing they're bringing in people from Hollywood directors producers writers and question him at length and getting people to name names so that they can bring up other people this is enough to ruin your career just put on a blacklist you can't get his job anymore a lot of people do lose their careers second question is it your right to be a communist if you want Constitution so they are actually violating the Constitution but they're trying to root out on the stupid station to prepare the message what they don't want is the Communist message competing with the American dream sales fish they're coming out capitalism being ruined by communist so they're friends make the Communist bad guys and go out couple interesting people rise prominence on the national scene because of this there was a young energetic very dedicated congressman who really makes a name for himself he is sort of McCarthy's right hand man in the house his name Congressman Richard Milhouse Richard Nixon this is how he runs his National promise okay another person who becomes very well appointed the head of the Screen Actor skills for those of you don't know what the Screen Actors field is this is basically the union for all Hollywood actors and actresses if you want to act in a movie you have to be a member of The Screen Actors too they won't hire you otherwise so this is their Union in the head of that Union was giving names he was selling out the people who were members in other words it's his job to protect his members instead he's selling them out he's passing names to the house on American Avenue he will ultimately testify himself his name Ronald Reagan this is what month California who want to have two of the three largest landslides in the history of America the only one who beat him Washington only got it okay has the US government emerged in the Cold War and this new fascination with nuclear weapons was taking people other things start happening all sorts of different products start using new technological scenes associated with advances in the Cold War start getting rocket pins they start getting wings like Jets they start looking at your points the cars 350s are pretty distinct number you guys seen 50 stars they're kind of cool they're different design than any other generation they're interested and the reason is because they're being affected by this cold war mindset also Atomic technology starts in getting introduced into water products and do that end I want to talk about some of the things that I want to show you something that we've been talking about here all right okay let's take a look at the American dream in action here Chevy is selling a new station web be by that dad and son getting up okay maybe they working PJ they probably be in like shirts and jeans or something but okay so clearly straight out of bed I'll buy that part what about this she said a hairdo that would take her 45 minutes in front of a mirror put together in a bathroom with electricity this outfit you ever see a woman dress like that in a camping trip no this is not believable but the whole message here is with this with this you can bring your civilization with me you're still sophisticated we can still have the creature company look she's still got the coffee pot the eggs home full domestic cape songs the very capable mom it was very capable station that's the message oh little short for being here but okay now let's take a look at this one this one is the top end of the American dream do they have that Big White House they don't just have a white house they have the White House look at that thing tell me that that doesn't look like the White House the only thing is missing is that little area right there with that little thing that comes out like that you take off the rest there's The West Wing right there they got White House okay so this guy is clearly up here so this is a car of a Fortune 500 CEO this is a car of the elite Arian idea of blonde hair if you can look close enough you probably have blue eyes now they're supposed to have two kids right only one kid in this one only one kid in Paris all of this but notice that you can't tell if a boy or a girl that's how they get away with it yeah big fluffy dog they might not know they might only have one kid if they got two dogs okay and they're not just little dogs they're great danes they don't get me bigger than that these things are basically horses that little kids can ride around these things are here good luck with great dangerous you see those things unload man you need a dump truck okay now let's take a look at this one the American dream in action okay what do they tell people get married buy a house buy a car right that's the progression they got married now they're buying the car we need a new car but hey we're a little strap for cash well that's okay think you're just said oh Pick Your Price maybe you're just getting started out like that you can go for a cheaper model maybe you have more money you can buy one of the nicer ones like this one pick your DeSoto take your price no we have something for everyone I love this one because the advertisers did not think this through okay let's take a look at this one first of all big white house with the house that you were envisioning kind of look like that Jordan okay you got that go on out front big floppy dog check they floppy dog We're The Kids here my kid that means dad now has time to enjoy the fruits of all the years of his work this is Dad's time and this is Dad's car this is Dad's fun car

her fun oh yeah they didn't really think that was true how long is technology ideas you can use it in many different ways the four nucleon 1958 a prototype car nuclear power but for some reason they just didn't get the government to loan them a nuclear reactor to test it out gee I can't imagine why the Radioactive life by the way you don't want to use them unless of course you enjoy cervical cancer and uterine cancer testicular cancer movie toys Atomic toys yourself this is a stem kit project build your own Geiger County here's a nuclear test kit it actually came with uranium 238 yeah really good comic book how did Spider-man become Spider-Man radioactive spider okay so you get some ideas of some of the ways all these ideas have practice American culture all right see you on Wednesday have a good one</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/1460%20Apr%2026/","title":"1460 Apr

World War II and the American dream created a consumer culture based on that American Dream but it was also a very well defined one it said in order to be a good American you want to be loyal you want to be patriotic you want to be a good American you have to pursue this dream what about the people who don't want to what about people who don't feel comfortable in that for the people who want to go on get that white collar job enter the hamster wheel rat race and work and work and save and save and one day be able to indulge in the profits of their hard work over time they're not interested in getting married they're not interested in having kids maybe they don't want an eight to five job maybe that's not them and they kind of feel out of place what's more the pressure by America to push on people this American Dream America's doing it to keep the economy rolling and they're using everything in their Arsenal to keep people spending and that's okay as far as it goes but at a certain point the Conformity that they are forcing on America suddenly makes people question again is this really the land of the free because their feelings more and more trapped inside that box what's more when you couple that with the paranoia and the overt oppression that is caused because of the cold war and how they're pushing you should be afraid of the Soviet Union big bombs going off oh boogie man boogie man boogie man A lot of people are going this isn't my country this isn't how I want my country to be this isn't my life I want my life to be different than this and so you're going to start seeing push back against this and that is what we're going to talk today about that is the rise of the counterculture and it's significance in consumers one of the big groups in the post World War II period that really was part of this pushback in fact they were in a large extent leading the pushback against this American Dream Conformity that is being forced on you they become known as The Beat Generation and they mean beat because they are exhausted they're tired they're beat and in many ways they are very very similar to The Lost Generation that followed World War 1 and remember when we were talking about The Lost Generation they came home and progressivism had changed America in such a short time in the veterans felt like they were under attack and a lot of people suddenly started looking around at how controlling everything had become they said ooh this isn't the America I want and they will ask Patriots they'll go live in Europe instead people like Hemingway Fitzgerald Stein and others well you're going to see some of that similarity here except they're pushing back against different things back then the over social control that they had from progressivism was certainly part of it but also the heavy criticism the lack of jobs the white spread Union Uprising all of the chaos and people were just going this isn't right this is chaotic I don't like this and they'll leave because of that but the post World War II period was not a downturn it was an upturn things got better for people the economy is rolling in fact it is more than rolling it is steamrolling it is going Hog Wild it's booming but a lot of people look at this saying yeah but am I getting anything positive to me is this bringing meaning to my life okay so we have more stuff but what does it really mean we have to fit inside this narrow box to be a good American and so there's a pushback from that the Beat Generation writers are some of the first who really enunciate this feeling that put it into work put it into songs in a way these guys are kind of like what you would think about as people who have slam contests at Starbucks at night you know out in big cities like San Francisco New York wherever you know they dress in dark clothes they are kind of Outsiders they're they don't really fit in society what would you call those people today come on people hanging out at coffee shops at night indulging artistic whims operating outside the box all the time they drive a smart car they bring their lunch in a violin case stuff like that hipsters right I say hipster and what do you think of people wearing skinny jeans buying a latte pretty much well guess what these guys are the original hipsters in fact that is the name for themselves that they accept hipsters so the Beat Generation writers start making a huge impact they're challenging this American Dream idea they're challenging the Conformity they're challenging the lack of Freedom it has and the critics who are trying to maintain this American Dream Conformity this consensus period where everybody is supposed to think and act and behave exactly the same way as everybody else well they fire back at these people in increasing amounts and so attention is rising between them now the 1950s were really interesting times because this also happened to be the rise of the Space Race now let me ask you guys a question who got on the scoreboard first in the space race in Russia and what did they do first satellite but Nick good yes buttoning and from that point on everything associated with Communism anytime you wanted to associate something with Socialism or red you wanted to throw that suspicionate people question their American identity now they had a way to identify that they had on the Nick from Sputnik you'll start hearing all sorts of new labels for things and every time they want portray them as communist they throw that Nick on the end and so the Beat Generation became known as the beatniks and that's sort of the name of that stuff this is what beat next look like and actually this is a great photograph I love this and the reason I love this is because there's a couple very very famous people in this Photograph first off do you guys know who that is anyone who's that guy second in from the right Bob Dylan very good one of the biggest protests artists who performed you know singing during the 60s he was a big name in the anti-war movement and his songs were very influential well he was a beaten he was part of that beat generation the writers and singers and artists of this period of time so having him here shows his shows that he is actually in this before he becomes a famous musician and then this guy on the right I'm pretty sure most of you don't recognize him does anybody recognize him anyway end of the two biggest writers associated with the Beat Generation he's one of them the other being Jack Kerouac Jack Kerouac and Alan Ginsburg are the most recognizable names he is famous for a poem that he wrote called Howell has anybody read that in their classes or anything no okay well it was very distinctive and it became internationally famous it's what he's most known for how old was him screaming at how everything was wrong why what was wrong in order to be a good loyal American you had to pursue the American dream husband wife two kids suburbs eight to five job rat race two cars a mortgage right well enter him he doesn't like suburbs he prefers life in the city he's not going to get married because he's gay he's not going to have kids and he hates the idea of being stuck in an office for 8 to 10 hours a day he doesn't want that rat race he wants a different kind of life and the reason he writes howl is because so many people are attacking the people who don't fit inside that box this becomes a voice that an entire generation start identifying with even if they're not gay they can understand where he's coming from and what the frustrations they have are because he starts enunciated now the interesting thing about these guys they are incredibly influential in how Society will start to take shape why do I say that well first of all they are starting to reject mainstream American values they're pushing back against it one of these things is rejection of the Christian or I should say the judeo-christian norm that rises in this period of time the judeo Christian Community that is at the core of the American dream is being challenged by these guys they're interested increasingly in eastern mistressism Asian religions Buddhism Hinduism taoism Etc and they start checking them out some of them will start practicing those Allen Ginsberg is famous because he learned how to play the sitar which is very popular in India and he starts playing Indian music while he's I love how the computer just seems to have a mind of its own sometimes okay so this push back with religion is just part of it he actually Embraces Hinduism another thing is these guys are the guys who start the sexual Revolution free love it's famous in the 60s right who do you associate with the free love moment anyone hippies you know what hippies means hipster the hippies came out of these guys these guys are the ones who laid down the foundations of what the hippies will become they will Embrace their rebellion and resistance sexual Revolution begins with them these guys are the forerunners of the hippies another thing that they will do they will start using drugs to expand their Consciousness and see things in the world in a different way if you read the writings of the beat writers if you read Jack kerouac's famous book on the road which which really persuaded an entire generation of kids to get in the car travel across the country to California and do something unique different he did that with one book and then Alan Ginsburg and his writing will be interesting thing about the writing of the beat Riders it all shares a certain labor feel a certain characteristic and a lot of people think it's probably because most of that writing was done when they were high okay now what are they high on well of course they're doing some pot every now and then well more than now and then all the time but they're drug of choice when they're going to be writing was not marijuana they were expanding their Consciousness they don't want to make their mind slow down they want to change his perspective it is a hallucinogen yes they're drug of choice was much magic mushrooms now I'm taking for granted that most of you probably have never had magic mushrooms yeah I'm not going to put you on the spot in case you have okay not going to ask you to raise your hand on this one all right probably 2:30 probably go up and the others are probably going no not going to touch that stuff or yeah I've done it but I'm not going to admit it okay magic mushrooms are different basically what the world looks like when you take magic mushrooms it's not like taking LSD where everything starts moving in and out of shapes and warping and all kinds of stuff it's different it basically makes you a kid in a candy store everything Suddenly It's just amazing the colors are more vibrant everything is fun and amazing it's like an eight year old going to Disneyland for the very first time that's kind of what magic mushrooms do to people and with that that childlike approach and the Innocence that goes with it is a characteristic of their writing but also with it comes an idealism a belief that the world doesn't have to stay this way we can make it better there's a romantic notion to it colored with a heavy dose of reality that's what makes it so unusual it is both realistic and idealistic at the same time that gives it an interesting field and that's a characteristic of all the hipsters writing the beatniks that's why there's stuff sounds a lot to say okay they focus on the limits of free expression how Conformity is so restrictive to people it is basically alienating a lot of people in society making them feel like Outsiders and it is also tapping into a rising feeling in the Youth of America who are getting raised within this American Dream structure sin I don't like what I'm feeling they don't know why they don't like it but they do know that their entire life is planned out ahead of them and they are reluctant to take that first step can you guys relate to that getting out of high school facing college and you're going home man everybody pushing me on that path is that the path I want to be on maybe maybe I want to take a different path maybe I want to go over there and that questioning is part of being young you want to figure out what you want to do in life right you want to figure out the direction it's going to go well they all see the direction going One Direction there's a super highway for the American dream and no side roads there's no way to get off the interstate and this is causing the young people to question too these guys are the Forefront of rebellion but the Youth of America are rebelling too they just don't know how to enunciate it they don't know how to put it into words one of the biggest examples of this was in 1955 the release of a movie of one of the most famous actors of this time James Dean what's he known for what movie anyone I mean he's done a lot of movies but there was one big one he was really known for anyone nobody how many people have heard of James Dean okay well that's something at least okay talk about a theme for a generation their rebelling against something they're not quite sure why but they know they don't fit and so they start acting out but they don't really have a target for their acting out they're just rebelling and so you start seeing this big team and early 20s early young adult Rebellion on a wide scale basis this is where you start seeing things like if you heard of American Graffiti movie way back when Harrison Ford played a street racer in that movie yeah people start acting out leather jackets the bonds Grease you guys heard of any of these okay well that Rebellion that leather jacket I don't want to be part of it smoking cigarettes off in the corner I leave me alone kind of thing that became White spread so even though they don't have the definition they are still part of this seething rebellion and James Dean becomes the poster child why this becomes his last movie right after filming Rebel Without a Cause he got into a car accident and died he rolled his car and he had a convertible he died and he died young so he forever will be symbolized with this Rubble Without a Cause young person screaming out against the Conformity of society and ultimately getting killed by his own impulses he will become the symbol of rebellion for an entire generation he becomes a hero of the young people and a martyr to their cause now there's another person who's becoming very influential in this period of time also and his name is Elvis Elvis Presley the king now when we talk about the beatnics we've talked about the sexual Revolution their experimentation with drugs the music that they're creating what do we got here sex drugs and rock and roll beat next for the guys who basically invented that well he's the guy who lived it drug addict check alcoholic check famous for sleeping with any woman that will sit still for more than five five seconds check he actually had his own bedroom in the Playboy Mansion did you know that he was a visitor to the Playboy Mansion Hugh Hefner invited him in and when he was there there was it is a legend there that he actually spent the night with eight of the 12 Playmates for that year the women who are in the centerfold after he stayed there and left you Hefner roped off the room and he wouldn't even let it be cleaned up and for years only his friends and people that he really wanted to share it with he would open the door and show them but he would never let anybody go in now I don't know what they've done with it since for all I know the new purchasers of the I mean it was sold after he died but the Playboy Mansion was legendary for a long time and that room was sort of a shrine to Elvis especially after he died in 1977 but yeah right oh yeah yeah his relationship with Priscilla was well odd to say the least you guys know that their daughter just died not long ago yeah Lisa Marie okay did you know that she was married to Michael Jackson okay now Elvis he was different rock and roll thing now rock and roll at this point had been an underground music scene and it was largely in the African American Community Elvis is the guy who took it mainstream this is when rock and roll becomes big now he was not the person who invented it but he is the person who made it nationally huge because of the young people and how they responded to him his music was also distinctive he starts talking about or singing about very sexual theme ain't nothing but a hound dog crying all the time why is he crying he's horny yeah and when you couple that with the dance that he's doing here he starts thrusting his hips at the crowd while he's thinking nothing but a hound dog and so it's very suggestive and the older Generations both of the music and the reaction of their parents and that just encourages them to listen to it more because it's listening to Elvis becomes a form of rebellion he takes off the rising social norms of this generation this young group of the 50s and early 60s who are coming of age it's different they're looking at the American dream as being not something that they necessarily want follow now does that mean all of them no truth is probably 70 to 80% of them look at the American dream sand that's what I want but what about the other 20 to 30% their questioning and they're very loud in their question a very famous author he want to pull it sir anyway he wrote an article called the white negro no understand that he is playing on a lot of the stereotypes for African Americans that are still prevalent in a white supremacist country because this is pre-civil Rights era we haven't really moved into full civil rights at this point the battle is going on but when he writes this he's playing on those prejudices he says basically the only life-giving answer to the monotony of conformity this restricted American Dream was to abandon physical and spiritual Security in other words give up their religion give up this future job that would have them doing the rat race for years and years and instead delt straight into the world of instant gratification why save for tomorrow when you can spend today why worry about what's going to happen in the future when you can be dead they see people dying all the time by the mid 60s people their age where where are their generation dying 60s people there we go a lot of there friends their neighbors people that grew up with so over to Vietnam and they don't come home alive if they come home at all they come home in the middle box and that's waking up a lot of the Youth of America especially in the 60s a work ethic that the American dream encourages leads to postpone gratification Norman mailer sets and he says instead they're following the imperative selfishness the imperatives of self what they want they don't really care about what they should be doing they only care what they want to do now if it feels good for you instant gratification basically he says on these two Polar Opposites you have the man and the great flannel suit who was following the American dream and on the other hand you have the American history and the kids are moving over to the fitness category he Associates that with the Moors of black society music style calling rock rock and roll he's still calling it Jazz but their taste for jazz drugs slang and the moral disregard they average sexual appetites that blacks are supposed to have in other words he's commenting on the sexual Revolution he says it this is basically their way of resisting cold water pressure this is their way of saying I don't feel comfortable in this and so this is how they're reacting to it what are they looking for they're on a quest for an authentic experience they want something real he says basically they're looking at Society being over civilized and it becomes artificial in the process now the interesting thing about mailer despite the racial undertones or overtones if you will of his writing is that he actually Nails a lot of it right on the head not his comparison to black society but what the kids are thinking what they're feeling what they're going through and why they're doing it he says it's all about a disdain for Wonder Bread Tail Fins suburbs and everything plastic they look around at the society America has become and they see that it is artificial everything's fake you know why Wonder Bread is so wonderful why it creates so much wonder you wonder where the nutrition went they took the bread out of the bread and left you with what something that tastes good and contributes no positive benefits to your health sugar yeah and so he's just people are reacting to this this over civilized thing where they're forcing everybody into this little box and everything is artificial the cars are made to look like planes and Rockets they don't even look like cars what happened to cars looking like cars why decorated with all this other crap and make it look fake why don't we go back to the normal he says the kids of this generation are looking for something real something authentic and all they're seeing is fake artificial and hypocrisy everywhere they look by the 1960s resisting conformity was elevated to a whole new level and one place it really launched forward was Berkeley the Free Speech movement was led by a Berkeley student named Mario Savio seen here basically these students had put out some flyers and printed some things to distribute on campus that said we don't really like what's going on in Southeast Asia this was in 64 so the war in Vietnam hadn't fully kicked in yet but we had troops in the area and it was clearly ramping up tensions were building Anderson we don't like what's going on there we don't think America should really get involved here and they start speaking out about it well the University of California Berkeley censored them they said no you can't distribute them and they confiscate those flyers and they start holding demonstration saying we have a right to put that out there and Berkeley called in the cops and had the students at that rally arrested well the problem here is Berkeley is one of the elite universities in California and a lot of really really important and wealthy people send their kids there and some of them just got arrested and so the Berkeley president at the time he gets this phone call thing yeah you know you just arrested my son in this rally well I'm very sorry but he was participating yeah yeah you arrested my son in this rally and you know that 5 million dollar donation I was going to make for that new edition onto X building I think we're going to go a different direction sorry and that started happening again and again and again and the university president's going oh my gosh this is a capacitor and so in order to play Kate the parents it allows the students to do what they're going to do but keep in mind was he in violation of the law actually yes Berkeley is a public institution not private if the president at USC had pulled this he could get away with it legally the president at Berkeley Berkeley is a state school it has Public Funding which means it is government and the government is bound by the Constitution and the First Amendment says you can't restrict speech or freedom of the press and he was doing that so if this had gone to court Berkeley would have gotten slapped down hard for this so he reversed his position and what lesson did the kids learn all of these students who are protesting what did they learn if we stick to our guns and unite in common cause our voice can make a difference we you want to know why Berkeley ends up being the center of the protest world this is why because they've done it they've won which means they can win again so in the anti-war movement in the feminist movement in the Civil Rights Movement Berkeley will be right at the heart of a lot of those protests that become internationally famous when John Lennon from the Beatles comes over to what to walk in anti war marches and he's on the anti war bandwagger celebrities movie stars musicians alike they will all come to Berkeley we talked about Charles Manson and his appeal he's at Berkeley during this period of time and he has that appeal because his ideas are outside the box they're looking for that they're on a journey for something real they don't know what it is they just know that they're wanting it they're on a quest for it now why does this have something to do with consumerism well the truth is as much as the kids of the day of those 40s and 50s felt increasingly restricted and oppressed like the pressure of everything is waiting down on them and they're trying to keep it up the advertisers feel that way too they've been Trapped By The Genius of their own creation The American Dream has not just put a box around the American public it's put a box around them and the lid has been nailed shut they are looking for a way to get out of that trap and counterculture gives them the pry bar to get the lid of that is what they're going to ride right out of the Trap they're going to subvert it rejecting tradition embracing immediate desires self gratification the imperatives itself this is a retailers dream come true the advertisers are going to Stage their own creative revolution because they want to get out of this trap that they've created where everything has to fit into that American Dream now they're going to be breaking out of it and using that sense of rebellion being your own person the Quest for something real they're going to embrace it and they're going to subvert it for their own good you're going to use it for advertising and it will be jeans one thing that they to learn from doing this if I ask you when an Advertiser targets a group of people what do you call that group of people that they are targeting with their ass you're called what a demographic demographic okay you are a demographic you're all college students that makes you a Democrat but what advertisers figure out is if they tailor their demographics more specifically to who they're trying to reach their advertising becomes much more effective for example if you're trying to sell to email college students don't Target all college students so segmented demographics is something that emerges in this period of time and the best example of this in action is the battle between Coke and Pepsi the Colo now Coke has been around for years and Pepsi has been constantly trying to break into their Marketplace but they've been unable to do it hope has an ironclad hold on it but Coke markets their product differently than Pepsi won't then Pepsi will in this period of time and Pepsi does some pretty genius stuff so what is Coke do first of all Santa Claus what's he look like red hat red suit trimmed with what white fur what color is it red and white Coca-Cola created Santa Claus as we know him today before Coca-Cola came along when they portrayed Saint Nicholas he was generally wearing green they changed his outfit to red and white so it looked like Coca-Cola was Christmas and even to this day every time Christmas comes along you see Santa Claus holding mechanic Coke think about this as an international thing Santa Claus travels all around the world to all the boys and girls and delivers all the presents on Christmas Eve so that they wake up Christmas morning and ooh there they are Santa Claus and Coke Global they're selling to everybody all people are targeted by Coke take a good look at Coca-Cola's ads when they come out they show people of different ages different races different nationalities men women boys girls everybody holding hands and singing Kumbaya holy cow that's Coke Pepsi says let's do it differently here people why don't instead of focusing on selling to everyone we'll sell to the people who actually drink soda the most and so they do they come up with an ad campaign that was absolutely genius Pepsi be your own person don't drink cold at all drink the uncola drink 7 up and look what they're advertising here okay hear no evil speak no evil say no evil you know that whole thing the three monkeys doing their thing well they're hippies and they're in psychedelic colors they're clearly referencing counterculture you want to be a rebel you want to be counterculture don't don't settle for Cola that's Main Street even Pepsi is Main Street instead drink the uncola this campaign is still going with 7UP they still refer to themselves as the uncola Pepsi still says we are the choice of a new generation Coke says Kumbaya find its way into Automotive as well cars Oldsmobile has an unfortunate name old is part of their name and they want to try to convince younger buyers that their car is made for younger audiences so they say don't buy an old mobile buy a Young mobile instead and boy did they create some good ones you see that car there if that car were in perfect original condition today it would probably sell for somewhere between 80 and 100,000 they were part of the muscle car movement of this period of time big engines horrible gas money culture became the battleground of business competition and you know what else it did it's sped up rapid fashion obsolescence now we talked about fashion obsolescence right how Fashions go in and then they go out well instead of going in and out for a year maybe two years they're trying to do it every six months and then pretty soon they start doing it every four months and then they try to cram it down to three months to where they can get three or four Cycles a year that's what a lot of the advertisers and products are trying to do the more you can convince people well that's obsolete now there's something new they have to go out and buy new stuff will the kids are going whoa wait a minute things are going too fast and a lot of the kids will say you know what I don't feel any better buying these things and they start stripping their life down to simplicity get rid of a lot of the materialistic crap and focus on what they really value connecting with people and so you start seeing something unusual in the '60s rather than people getting more stuff in their life the kids start simplifying their lives by stripping the unnecessary stuff that doesn't have any way of making them feel better they get rid of it and they focus on the things that make them feel better they are on a quest for something real but guess what happens when advertisers start using counterculture every time you turn around when it's blaring from every radio when it's on every billboard when it's coming out of your TV set and inundating you what does it do all of a sudden counterculture becomes the new culture and it's no longer counterculture at that point is it when that becomes the dominant voice out there that's no longer the counterculture but what's unusual here is the dominant voice is the voice of the minority at this point most people are still on the American dream Highway they're still going for that and that's even to this day how many of you want to go out get a good job maybe an executive position have a good life buy a car buy a house get married have babies a lot of you probably want to do that kind of thing okay great well 80% of the American Youth want that but the other 20% are the only ones who are being heard so counterculture has become the new dominant culture even though most people don't follow it but the Quest for something real is something that people were looking for and it is in this that yet another car Advertiser figures it out big and it was Volkswagen now this is not something new this is actually a reverting to something older remember Henry Ford what time you changed it was either improve it or make it less expensive to manufacture quality durability those were his Hallmarks that's what he wanted to build well guess what we're seeing a return to that the same model T came out year after year now Volkswagen picks up on that the books wagon theory of evolution notice they're tying into Darwin the same car every year can you tell the difference no the design of the Volkswagen Beetle does not really evolve very much but those advertisers had a lot to overcome these guys had to reinvent this car why do you guys know the history of this car the Volkswagen Beetle this car was personally or at least had a hand personally by Adolf Hitler and it's designed it was known as the Nazi mobile yikes do you really want that stigma on your car specially at the Holocaust probably not and so advertisers have to come up with a way to reinvent this car and get people to look at it differently and not associated with you know Hitler so they start changing it it becomes now the young hip affordable car of you they also are famous for their sexist advertising I'll tell you that right now okay here's a good example she's ugly she's cheap and she gets around your car is a w**** but take a look what the record actually selling self mockery becomes a very powerful tool she's ugly again they put it out there hey we're not going to lie to you our car is ugly it's an ugly car but you know what at a certain point ugly sort of becomes cute too and a lot of people think that the beetle is cute but more than that she's ugly okay she's cheap this car is very inexpensive and for the Youth of America who don't feel like they want to buy a Cadillac for top dollar they just want something to eat cheap works and then she gets around she will get you from point A to B this car will do everything you needed to do it's transportation and it's affordable that's what they're selling but the self mockery and the reality of it is something new they're selling honesty brutally self-deprecating honesty that Quest For Real they tap into it and that really keys on with the younger generation the emphasize the changes would only be made to make the car function better and they start really openly scorning those car ads that are emphasizing these new changes that make the car so much better from this year from last year when really it's just cosmetics it's saying they don't respect your intelligence as a buyer but we do and you know what they actually have a point they didn't respect their particular intelligence the Volkswagen essentially had become the anti car for the rest of the car market this is the counterculture car that will move and when you think back to the 60s and what the hippies were driving or were they driving those right painted with flowers and psychedelic colors and all sorts of weird stuff though but notice the sexual yeah if you can sell her on this you can sell her on anything wrong and then there's this one another sex and stuff sooner or later your wife will drive home notice one of the best reasons in other words play bad drivers they actually do studies about this showing time and again women actually have far fewer accidents than men do yeah so this is starting to change people's opinion the young people of America are buying Volkswagens but in the 70s it really changes when Disney makes a movie about a mischievous troublemaking Volkswagen who rushes in and saves the day at the end and his name is Herbie the Love Bug and their success is complete the Nazi mobile has transitioned into the chief affordable car of Youth into and Hitler's forgotten talk about genius advertising these guys got their money they did it right and if you take a look at Volkswagens advertising today they follow the same basic approach to this they insult their own product and they tell you the truth about it that's something that they try to do okay so why is hip advertising taking over everything why is this becoming so big so powerful in selling well for one thing after World War II all those veterans came home and they either got married before they went over or as soon as they got home they immediately got married and what are they sure do cranking out kids like there's no tomorrow they're getting busy yeah and all of a sudden the families come along but they're not satisfied with the two kids per family they're starting to have three four five six kids eight kids 10 kids they're cranking our kids like there's no tomorrow and America gets it's single largest population swell in its entire history and that generation becomes known as the Baby Boomers now advertising around this period of Time start focusing on them why in 1969 50% of the American population was under the age of 25 half the country was under the age of 25 that is huge it's never been that high before and so as time goes on if you watch the advertising it'll stay focused on when you turn on your TV today what kind of ads do you see pharmaceutical thing companies new drugs dealing with arthritis and diabetes up see those Life Alert ads you see all that stuff right why because all of those guys are now in their 70s and 80s and advertising is still following them like a sunflower following the Sun yeah so the lesson of consumerism what are the ads for playing they tell you straight out consumerism is a fraud but you're smart enough that you know that it demands that you act like everybody else and fit in but you you're an individual you're a rebel it's okay consumer culture will try to sell you shoddy products that don't do anything for you and fall apart quick but you know better than to fall for that you crave something real you crave often history but you're too smart to fall for all that stuff that the ad people are throwing at you oh yeah you know better than to listen to us notice that they're calling themselves Liars but they're telling the truth aren't they yes consumer cup consumer culture Fosters conventions that are unfulfilling and unfulfilling and repressive now is that true will stop make you happier something's Mike but it won't guarantee happiness hip Trends can smash through all that garbage no more stifling mores of the past Conformity has been the bulwark of society they're telling you you have to fit in that box but now it's different you can be outside of the box it's about diversity now be your own person be a rebel just like everybody else did you catch that there's the ultimate Paradox of their selling be a rebel like everyone else well if you're like everyone else it's not Rebellion is it it's just standard well that's what they've done they have essentially normalized Rebellion being a rebel is not rebellious if you want to look at the real Rebellion at this time it's the people who ignore all this crap go to college have a pocket protector the nerd glasses with the tape on it they go through it they get a job they get an engineering position and they go on and make a great living for the rest of their life those become the real Rebels all of a sudden it's kind of flipped over another important thing that they figure out sell to women advertising has been dominated by men forever and around this period of time they start figuring out hey you know we'd be a lot more effective if we're selling to women they're starting to figure that out but they don't quite have the hang of it do they there's still a lot of sexism in this and a lot of women have been going they're so insulting yeah absolutely yeah and they're getting much better at selling to him and the reason because they actually start hiring more women that's you want to talk about the way advertising actually gets better at selling to women that's it hire more women at exits and you'll get better well this is what they start doing and again what were the two big industries that you really have to watch for to be the ones who are the ones who revolutionized advertising cars cigarettes these guys hit a home run not just a home run these guys hit a grand slam Virginia Slims this was one of the most genius marketing campaigns ever why they've been trying to figure out how to get women to smoke for years and some women do but what do they actually do here Virginia Slims isn't just encouraging women to smoke they came out with a line of female cigarettes the cigarettes are female if you are a male smoker you feel uncomfortable smoking one of these even if you have to bum it off someone okay I can speak from experience yes I'm a former smoker I quit a long time ago but when you're addicted to nicotine and all of a sudden you look at your pack and you're going oh my gosh I'm out I got to get a smoke you start looking around huh there's a lady over there who's smoking I'll go by myself sure sure I still feel kind of weird this doesn't make me a woman with estrogen these cigarettes were female it was uncanny but you know what no ad campaign tied into the women's smoking Market better than this they created cigarettes specifically made for women they were a little skinnier and a little longer they have the same amount of tobacco that the other ones have what's more lady like when they were smoking then if they were smoking another cigarette this was a genius marketing campaign and it convinced a whole bunch of female smokers to flock to their brand sold off the shelves absolutely incredible but if you really want to take a look at the big genius when it came to selling to women it came because of a piece of legislation how many of you have heard of the educational Amendments of 1972 anyone there is a specific section of the educational Amendments of 1972 called Title Nine if you heard a Title Nine or you may not have heard of okay I see some of you shaking your heads okay there is a Title Nine office over in the Student Union it is a gender Equity office that's what Title Nine is all about let me read to you exactly what Title Nine says no person in the United States shell on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied benefits from a benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance every public school in America in other words what this means is if you have programs for boys you have to have programs for girls if you have programs for men you have to programs for women if you have a men's baseball team you have to have a woman's softball you have a man's soccer team you have to have a women's soccer team in the picture you have a men's yeah this one they hate you text Texas but what if you don't have enough women to feel the team then you have to let the women join the boys team and Texas they kind of went no they can't make us do that because if you don't let the girls on the boys team they can pull your federal funding ouch and so Title Nine becomes a big deal in public education and remain so to this day now why does that matter it matters in a big way think about sports in the '60s and how they changed in the 70s who played Sports in school in the 50s and 60s did you see any girls teams boys play the sport they're the ones on the floor what are the girls doing cheerleaders talk about a metaphor for Life the boys are the doers the girls are on the sidelines cheering him on all of a sudden the educational amendments in 1972 are saying no the girls get to be on the field too this generation will go on to become Fortune 500 CEOs women who have been shut out of executive positions will rise up to the very highest echelons of international businesses because of this and it all starts with sports saying you don't have to be on the sideline you can go play soccer too get out there play basketball you want to play basketball shorts no problem well Sports companies companies that were putting out sporting equipment like Adidas and Converse we're putting out products for boys they didn't put out products for girls so now that they're suddenly a demand for girl stuff they go oh okay I guess we take the boys stuff and make it a little smaller girl but they didn't really give the girls what they needed they just kind of modified what the boys have it was really when a man named Phil Knight teamed up with the head track coach from the University of Oregon I got by the name of Bill Bauer Bill Bowerman when he came into the University of Oregon came into a program that was a historic bottom feeder of a school okay they hadn't won anything they were garbage and he came in and he takes a look at his athlete's shoes and says 10,000 M wearing shoes that are heavy if you can cut even one ounce off of that shoe add that up over 10,000 steps and tell me how much weight you're not carrying anymore that's just one ounce he is able to reduce the weight of the shoes that is athletes are wearing like 2/3 because he makes them himself he pulls out his waffle iron in his kitchen and his wife hates him for it okay he starts cooking rubber on the waffle iron to make the soles and then he custom makes the shoes for every single one of his athletes and then the University of Oregon starts winning national championships year after year and Bill Knight and Bill Bowerman say hey this this should be our Focus making better products that are Taylor Made to the people who use them women they say let's take a look at the physical needs of women athletes later to death what do women mean you think Converse was putting out sports bras at this point in time Adidas didn't even think about it Nike did when they formed Bill Bowerman and Bill Knight formed a company called Blue ribbons Sports and later they rename their company and more than anything else from propelling Nike to Super startup putting them on the top of the athletic market and keeping them there they gave women athletes what they needed and where the men's Market was split evenly among the various companies all the women went to one place they cater to women's needs and the women responded by buying their products because their products were better for women than anybody else's and this shot them up to the top of the market now did they put out some good ads for men's products too oh yeah 1985 was a big year in fact there's a movie out about it right now have you guys seen it if you have it it's great it's fantastic you'll see it the movie about Nike taking on Michael Jordan and creating a new line of shoes just for him the Air Jordans I had a pair of those first generation Jordans Madison how much they be worth today yeah you know the red white and black ones I actually had a pair of those when I was in teenage High School's colors were red white and black so it fit in with the Chicago Bulls the red white and black of Michael Jordan shoes so Nike became big because they were the first ones to truly cater to the needs of the female athletes that were on the rise and they will become popular ever ever after this so this was a big Leap Forward okay that's it for today have a great weekend I'll see you Monday chances are we will finish up next week we can give you a good week off to help you settle in and prepare for finals and whatever else okay have a good one</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/1460%20May%2003/","title":"1460 May

so he wanted to get those numbers down he wanted to get more people into the economy but also he needed to get the econom y that was stagnant scene that was the Great Depression no Roosevelt tried to fix the Great Depression with the New Deal Social programs and work programs but what was the failure was it that the program wouldn't work why did that new deal not pull America out of the depression he simply didn't spend enough and it wasn't him all fairness he wanted more money into it it was Congress Congress didn't want to spend the money on all of this so they were a little reluctant to throw the amount of money that would be needed to get the government however World War II and the wartime economy was booming enter the '70s and the economic crisis and how Reagan interprets the past he looks at Roosevelt 's program of them as social assistance programs and jobs programs to help people and said well that didn't work what didn't work military spending rather than spending money on social assistance program which he really couldn't sell the phone you wouldn't be able to get the amount of money he needed selling social so the social programs for push the side in fact most of them got slash they got their funding would reduce why he was spending a lot more on military spending we had to get the money from somewhere part of it came from budget in other areas like welfare homelessness programs jobs programs things like this end up getting cut he had some successes there but it was slow going at first this new economic system really isn't a new one it's been done before the person who was the brainchild behind the New Deal John Maynard kind Cape Pines and he laid the foundation for what became known as Tunisian economics based on his last name economics basically is fixed the government or fix the economy rather using government spending okay that's that's what amazing is they also call it supply side economics if you are an economic class you find me an econ major you'll hear about supply-side economics quite a bit over there okay so this has been done before but in this period of time Reagan is taking it his own directions so where Roosevelt had the New Deal Reagan has something that becomes labeled Reaganomics that would also gets a couple other names Reagan says the way to do this is to grow money at the top and then let it trickle all the way down synonymous however as trickle down economics started to work the people at the top who are already rich got really rich the people who were in the middle were the middle class during the 70s had shrunk small part of America compared to what it had been before middle class under the lower middle class like somebody opened an umbrella and was sitting there over the people on the trip le Free the trickle just wasn't making it all the way down so yeah it was nice in theory it really caused the Resurgence of the middle class if you were middle class in America You Love rating reason I'm ready for it come on everybody else is getting triple where's mine but they didn't get any so it was like there was an invisible barrier for the people in the lower class the middle class did Fabulous the lower class did not the working people the blue collar labor the urban takes off one of the first programs that he starts throwing money at it's called the Strategic Defense i is anybody know what the nickname of this program was Star Wars very good yes Reagan came into office in 1981 in 1977 one of the most influential movies in modern history was put out into the theaters and it had a huge imp act yeah Star Wars isn't dead they still keep coming out with new movies related to that Star Wars world so Star Wars of course better all right good okay so Reagan being an actor and understanding the real power that movies can have in people's lives really keys in on Star Wars and starts getting these ideas of pushing the technology people are inspired by the lasers and the the fighting going on and you know it's kind of a underdog coming up and winning npn that's sort of the big theme of this well then came out the secret right after he took office and the sequel was if anything even bigger than the original it was one of the great sequels in history very few movies actually have good sequels but this was one where the sequel was probably better than than the original and that was The Empire Strikes Back but The Empire Strikes Back doesn't just inspire people it gives him a visible thing to use in his own characterization of the Cold War all of a sudden the boogeyman that they've been selling for the Cold War the Soviet Union has suddenly become the evil empire and if you take a look at Star Wars Star Wars is influence by the Cold War but it also influences the Cold War how do I mean well when Luke and Darth Vader are fighting with each other what color is Darth Vader's lightsaber red Soviet Union what color is Luke's blue now later by the time he gets to the Return of the Jedi he then has a green one that he's made but yeah he had a clue lightsaber so here you had the red versus the blue in this big Showdown and Reagan will end up delivering one of the most famous presidential addresses in history became known as the evil empire spe ech where he was literally talking about the Soviet Union in the same language that you would talk about Star Wars he was portraying the Soviets as the evil empire who want to conquer basically the Galaxy and it's up to us to stand up to them we have a moral responsibility to stand up to them and this became part of the momentum of him getting his military programs approved okay so this was one of them and they even nicknamed this one Star Wars according to the history books this ultimately Ended as a failure but didn't really first of all what is Strategic Defense Initiative it was a system in the satellites to shoot down any nuclear missiles that might be fired at the United States especially Soviet ones shoot them down before they can blow up and what you what would you shoot him down with lasers pew pew which is why it was called Star Wars okay satellites could they put them up into space at this point in the 80s yeah matter of fact they had just started a new program in NASA called the space shuttle which was specifically designed to carry to carry cargo up into space and turn it loose so we were putting up huge amounts of satellites throughout the 80s and what about the Laser Technology could they make a laser that was strong enough to destroy a nuclear missile yeah they actually saw that one too the Laser Technology the money that they put into that was huge and schools like MIT Caltech Stanford USC UCLA Berkeley and Harvard we're really the big movers and shakers in the laser world so they solved it they threw enough money at the programs of the universities to solve those and then they went on and applied those why didn't they get it to work well here's the problem do you know how fast the nuclear missile reaches at its peak what kind of speeds it can go $25,000 miles per hour that's as fast as f*** okay so if you're going to shoot down something that is moving 25,000 miles per hour how hard is that to hit well let me put it in this terms do you know how fast a bullet from a rifle travels 3000 mph or less some less but say a high-powered rifle 3000 miles per hour this is traveling eight times that speed yikes so what is the big problem with SBI they couldn't get a fast enough computer to make it work but let's look at this today that only needed a faster computer in order to make it work everything else the technology was there you want to know something really freaky you see this this has a computer in it that is so far beyond that the computer in a smartphone could easily run that system do we have those up in the sky today if you ask the government they will say no I would say they're lying that's my personal voice I think this is alive and well I think they put it up there I could be wrong but that's my guess okay so SDI It ultimately was a money sink for $15 billion dollars to be dumped into the industry wow just on this program alone that's a lot of money especially if they're saying well it failed but didn't fail even on the surface okay let's say we didn't put any satellites up there that can shoot down nuclear missiles was it really a failure we developed better space going technology we developed better ways to deliver satellites we developed better satellites to put into space which now form things like telling Communications when you make phone calls sometimes they go over satellites global Positioning Systems how many of you have used Google Maps or some other kind of navigation system on your phone well the satellites tell you where you are so we've got all of that coming out of this so this is really the groundwork for other big advances that come along later also what about lasers okay so we made big powerful lasers but Laser Technology as a whole Advanced dramatically after this what can you do with lasers now manufacturing with laser Precision laser cutting also what about Surgical you want to get your eyes fixed they've got a laser procedure for correcting your vision they also have one that can actually reattach your retina if you have a detached retina that used to make it blonde now they can weld it back in place with a laser they have Micro lasers that they can put inside of you through little slits and do all the stuff in in a lesson invasive way than cutting you wide open so all of that is technology that was forwarded by this program so it wasn't entirely a failure now then we moved to the really big money sink still 17 came out in this period of time that was known as the stealth fighter even though it wasn't really a fighter it was more of a tactical bomber but it was pretty much invisible this thing was one of the most incredible aircraft ever created maybe the most incredible aircraft ever created that plane what color is it it looks black doesn't it it's not if it were black and you saw that up in the night sky you would actually be able to see it you can see a black plane this one was actually programmed by a supercomputer to pixelate the coating of it so that it took in various shades of different types of gray blending them together in a way that made it just fade out of existence you look up in the night sky you can't see this you can see where the stars might disappear in its silhouette but you cannot see the color you can't see that plane that was incredible and that's just the color what is stealth aircraft what are they known for why are they stealthy right they can't be seen on radar this was the most advanced stealth aircraft ever created at this point and reason being it had the radar cross section of a bird a large bird maybe a goose or an eagle but a bird now if you see a bird on radar you're not going to detect it as an airplane even if it's traveling 600 miles an hour okay so was this program successful absolutely we made 20 of them the problem is it was incredibly expensive initially we had plan to make something like somewhere between 1 and 200 of these and they were supposed to be 600 million dollars each well we only made 20 of them but we were still committed to the research to pay off the defense contractors so they actually made about 20 of them at a price of about two and a half to three billion dollars each each yeah that's what it cost to build a destroyer have we used those in war anybody know anyone at all Yeah we actually have we used them in Iraq both times because they couldn't be seen they were great for taking out the f-117s and b2's were both used to take out the air defenses after they killed all of Iraq's air defenses then they just started sending in B-52's and heavy carpet bombing place so it was really a very dramatic thing but what was this in the terms of the day the Cold War why is that significant well previous to this aircraft coming out Russia had just spent the equivalent of roughly 50 billion dollars expanding their radar Network across their country they had just upgraded it and created this radar net to detect any aircraft that might come into their air space and just a year after they announce okay this is done we've got the best air defenses in the world this comes out they just spent how much on radar and here's a ship they can't even see on it thanks so now think of this in the terms of the Soviets perspective we were working on a system that we say didn't work but even they are suspecting it did that one which shoots down nuclear missiles so the Soviets can attack us but we can shoot down what they attack or we can just hit him in a strike that they can't stop we have first strike capabilities and Reagan's aggressive language toward the Soviet Union made them genuinely afraid that we might be heading toward a nuclear exchange they were scared of this skull and this is one big reason why they start angling away from the cold war and start this process of heating up defrosting the Cold War and essentially ending it this is going to lay the groundwork for ultimately the end of the Soviet Union the breakup okay what has incredible consumer implications as well and not just all the models that people would build them and there were a lot of those they had such complex systems in there that if you were to put all the dials you know how when you look in an aircraft's cockpit there's like dials everywhere and switches everywhere and you're going man how can anybody keep track of all this well it would have been 10 times worse on this aircraft than any other aircraft that had ever been made so instead of that they came up with the system of having each the pilot and the co-pilot have three screens and the screens all you had to do is just touch your selections on those screens and it would pop up the control screen that you wanted and then you could back out of it you know what that laid the ground wire groundwork for touch screens on your phone came about because of this the B2 created that technology so all sorts of military funding I've only gone into a couple of the big programs but there are a lot of other ones okay military funding is skyrocketing in this period of time and anyone when he comes in things are a little sluggish by 82 people are going is this going to work we don't see any difference 83 recession over economy booming it was working and it was working big so by that point everything was rolling everything was moving and the people in the middle and the people on the top are going this is great lots of jobs better pay everything's getting better the people in the bottom are going we're not getting better you forgotten about us here going about their daily lives like the people on the bottom don't exist so they just kind of get ignored the wealthy massive the wealthy benefit massively because of this they are becoming really rich and a lot of that upcoming middle class is doing very very well too and many of them will become hugely affluent as well you think being a Microsoft product they would have come up with a way not to do that okay so the people at the top and the people in the middle are benefiting hugely now keep in mind that the people who are now in that middle class getting wealthier period those are the same people who in the 60s were protesting the system marching out against how the tyranny of capitalism was ruining the world and now are they on that same bandwagon no most of them have jumped into the hyper consumerism going up this is what life's all about I protested this I shouldn't have been protesting this I should have been embracing it and so they become ultimately the huge symbol of hypocrisy in America the protesters of the 60s have become the upcoming Professionals of the '80s and they get labeled young upcoming professionals or some people would call them young urban professionals but ultimately the name they will get lashed on to them is yuppie young upcoming professional yup so they become yuppies now whether or not you know what a yuppie is you know what a yuppie is I can show you what a yuppie is oops let's talk about the criticism that's going on and then I'll show you I've got a picture of you hold on okay the trickle down economics because the people on the bottom weren't getting the Trickle it started to get a lot of negative press and one big name that it gets labeled was voodoo economics so Reaganomics trickle down economics voodoo economics they're all referring to the same basic policy but who's that explain trickle-down economics to me again grow money at the top and let it trickle down where's that money stand at the top and he says now try to get with the straight face yeah the people at the top or the ones engineering it and they're saying yeah I give us that trickle down and it's just not trickling down far enough and then you hear you see here this champagne film you guys have seen these probably before right where you poor champagne in the top one and it spreads down to the next level the next level in the whole idea is it's supposed to fill up the entire Fountain but they didn't put enough champagne in it to go all the way down so the trickle down wasn't trickling so there was a lot of social criticism to this program especially from the people on the bottom now Reagan will capitalize on some positive issues to Kickstart his presidency that will get him off on the right foot as well and one of those big ones what was one of the biggest things at the end of the seventies that people were really bothered about hostages in Iran they had been there for a year and a half and every day Iran trotted him out in front of the cameras burned an American flag showed the hostages blindfolded and and tied up and then they shouted death to America burned in effigy of Carter and went back in and repeated the same thing next day tomorrow same time let's go and they do it all over again and that was just constant every time on the Nightly News oh another protest in in Iran happened today so you know people were constantly inundated with it and they felt frustrated well the day Reagan takes office these same day January 20th 1981 people get to see this the hostages were released from Iran and they were flown out to Athens where they got off the plane here switched over to another plane that brought him back to the US the hostages were free and the interpretation of the American people is man they were so afraid Ronald Reagan would come after him they turn them loose before he even took office or on the day he took office not even give him the chance well that was something that was encouraged by the government they wanted that to be the interpret Carter had negotiated this and Reagan's people actually man aged stall the release of them they were there several months longer than they needed to be because they wanted this as a big visual on the day he took office starting things on the right foot now could Carter have complained about that given that he was the one who really negotiated it absolutely that could have been a great thing for him to campaign on too but ultimately he didn't why he wanted Reagan to be successful fixing America he felt like he had failed the American people when he left office he was actually crying in his farewell speech he felt like he had failed the people and so if this would get Reagan off on the right foot and he would be able to fix America if this is what it took he would keep his silence and let Reagan take credit for so we did but that also gives you a little insight into the character of the leaders too doesn't it Jimmy Carter was probably one of the leaders in American history who had the highest character he wasn't the best leader but he was probably the best person whoever took office and that saying something now Reagan created this system that created the Yuppie so let's take a look at what the yuppies look like now back to the young thing that's what yuppies look like you've seen them before you can see him down in Newport Beach right Costa Mesa Redondo Malibu go to any of those places you can see them and your reaction to them today is probably the same reaction a lot of people had of them back then yeah they have a hard life down there embracing conspicuous consumption they are wanting it you've heard that phrase if you've got it want it well that was very much alive and well in the eighties and people were flaunting left and right it wasn't enough just to have money they wanted to make sure everybody knew they had money they were spending it on massive mansions and Yachts and jets and supercars and whatever you can buy with money you want to buy an island go for it hey can speak use consumption and people would do that all of that was going on you guys know who Larry Ellison is CEO of Oracle big tech company up the Bay Area he's the guy who bought one of the Hawaiian Islands the whole island Lanai you bought the island I think that's what the fifth or sixth largest of the Hawaiian islands is Big he bought it so that's still very much alive and well yeah okay you mean that one yeah we haven't gotten to that one yet yes we're going to go through the music here very soon I'm sure you just saw all that but we'll go through it again okay so this culture of access conspicuous consumption is turning a lot of people against everything that's going on okay America's economy is improving for some people but it's not improving for others and for the people in the bottom who aren't getting any Improvement they're seeing the people at the top not only improved but want it and like grind it in how much better they are than the people on the bottom and they start treating them like crap yeah they're going to react to that and you start seeing a lot of social responses but probably the biggest was in music in the 70s you're starting to see this largely Urban working class culture that is reacting negatively to consumerism to capitalism to every piece of untrustworthy politician in office all of it they're hating it all and they say you know what we're tired of this and we just want to destroy the whole system Anarchy and musically this turns into anger frustration lashing out and with it you get the rise of the pumpkin 1982 was the first really big big year of punk it was rising in the 70s because of the frustration but then when they started seeing wealthy people get really wealthy and start to live a very aggressive flaunting lifestyle they became so disgusted with America they weren't alone and they had a big listening audience who were just as disgusted and frustrated as they were so Punk was on the rise hunk challenged religion it challenged politics it challenged Conformity and a society that was addicted to consumerism pop culture it hated it it saw it as bro kind of the way the Beat Generation saw the '50s plastic fake artificial it just wasn't real and rather than calling for improvement they're saying we should just tear the whole system down Burn It to the Ground start out of the ashes all over again Anarchy nihilism all of that is part of the punk approach to things politically charged you get groups like The Dead Kennedys anger frustration Anarchy you get groups like Black Flag unemployment and economic frustration you can see that with a lot of them Sex Pistols The Clash the Damned and a bunch of others one guy that became sort of the poster child of the punk movement was this guy Sid Vicious people who was contributing to the rise of the punk movement and in 1979 he died of a heroin overdose keep in mind that a big component of the punk movement was self-hatred loathing they were self-destructive they buried themselves in pain and problems and drugs and you know keep piling it on and so a lot of their destructive nature turned inward he was a good example of that dying of Heron a heroin overdose Sid Vicious became sort of the poster child of the Pokemon live fast Die Young fight for what you want make your voice heard and if you burn out along the way so be it there's nothing to live for anyway screw the whole system that's kind of punk in a nutshell that kind of frustration had a big impact in other areas as well but Punk was more influential than just the music style they gave rise to all sorts of new types of directions in music and one thing that was an outgrowth of the punk rock industry was the rise of New Wave New Wave was influenced by pump there was sort of a rebellion but at the same time it didn't have the same anger attached to it for the most part some of them were but there was they were heavily influenced by pop as well but what really influenced the new wave movement was something else a combination of two big things technology in instruments the new Rising technology is causing new changes in sounds that you can achieve with new instruments also women remember how we talked about the seventies and everything started changing for the women well the girls who grew up in the environment of the educational Amendments of 1972 Title Nine they had grown up through the '70s and now in the '80s they're going to be the punk rockers who then turn into the new waivers groups like The Go-Go's for example who started out as a punk group and then sort of became a popular way through other groups will focus on the technology and with that you get groups like Devo very electronically driven music pushing the boundaries of new sounds that the capabilities also you'll see Heavy Metal be affected by this guitars start sounding differently because they're coming up with all sorts of new sound effects that they can get guitars to do delay distortion law Reverb you name it they can do all kinds of different things and get new sounds out of it and so music evolves in the '80s in a way that was not really possible before it because they're simply able to make sounds that we're not possible possible before this affects a lot of different things but the frustration is also leading into other music types as well for example God the death Rock and Goth scenes will come heavy out of this same environment social mores they are objecting to they feel like Outsiders they are anti-conformists they hate that normal American society that Conformity that the pop culture is throwing on them all over again kind of sounds like the beatniks all over again doesn't it well it's not far off at least an attitude it inspires groups like of course the Cure you guys know who these are you know Robert Smith is some people do you ever see people dress like this today goth is still around it's not as prominent and and visible as it was back in the 80s but there are still people in that got sea that's something that is still alive another one that emerges is urban violence and anger the frustration over lawlessness that is rising as well as police brutality racism and a lot of the ongoing problems in the inner cities gangs are rising up challenging each other for territories because they're starting to take control of the drug trade and that's big money Wars of the '80s and 90s were brutal that was an ugly ugly time in the inner city and it affected music NWA how many of you have seen the movie did you like it they did a pretty good job didn't they yeah that was one where they didn't really take too many creative Liberties they didn't need to because the story was creative enough it was interesting but here you see NWA the rise of rap and hip hop also came out of this period of time and NWA these are the guys who took it from sort of an underground and made it huge now are they the first rap group no they had others who laid the groundwork before him Run DMC was one and there were others but these are the guys who really came out with an anger charged message it was anti-establishment it was critical of law enforcement talking about all the problems that they're having in the inner cities I mean it's all there basically what will become known as gangster rap will be an extension of what they established and a lot of them individually will go on to do other things significantly let's take a look at these guys Ice Cube he's an actor he's still acting today MC rent I think he died did he die I think he died Eazy-E he did die yellow he put out a solo album after the breakup he had one big hit I suppose you could call him a one hit wonder and that one has made him a massive living one song it gets used in movies it gets used in commercials all the time and if you heard it you would recognize it and then there's Dr Dre Dr Dre will go on to the biggest solo career of all of these guys and become a name in and of its own and then he will go on to do something else that affects all of you how many have them come on you know what I'm talking about two come on you're lying let's see him you know what I'm talking about right Beats headphones Beats by Dre those headphones everybody had to buy and they were good they weren't bad headphones but they had a style to them and they were being put out by somebody in the rap industry wrap and Hip Hop and that was something that a lot of people responded to because it had a heavy base component in it and that was good for hip hop listening to Hip Hop so Drake ends up selling his company to Apple for over a billion dollars yes or what okay I thought you died do you know what he's doing he retired yeah he was he was going to the guy I couldn't find really much about it it's like you faded you know okay but Eazy-E he came out with some solo stuff big hit during the '80s that you would probably recognize if you heard it today but these guys will spawn the next wave of Hip Hop that will take it into the future MC Hammer Dr Dre when he's solo Snoop Dogg all of these guys who really like the foundations of modern Hip Hop came out of these guys these guys were really the first big group to take hip hop to the next level so the frustration is causing a lot of creativity in the protesting through music so you see some people embrace the pop culture and other people rebelling against the pop culture but it has a big consumer effect whether you support it or not people are buying the stuff when you think of the '80s one big thing that comes to mind sports cars sports cars become common in the '80s and not just Corvettes we're talking Exotics Ferraris Lamborghinis Maseratis and the list goes on also you start seeing rules and Bentley and all the rest of those start rising up too excess it's not enough just to have a fast car you have to have one of the fastest cars you have to have an F40 you have to have a Porsche 959 Bill Gates bought one of those so did Paul Allen you guys know who they are right one of the founders of Microsoft Paul Allen also yeah and they both bought $959's the government wouldn't let him bring him into the country they were embargoed for 20 years on the docks and finally after 20 years they can bring him in as a classic car that don't apply to the same rules and now Bill Gates drives his to work his 959 is his daily his daily driver yeah it's kind of an interesting story but when people tend to think of the '80s in sports cars this is usually the one that comes to mind the Ferrari Testarossa becomes very iconic why was that one so popular why not one of the others why that one I mean it is kind of cool looking but why that one are there faster cars yes other cars that handle better yes it is a Ferrari and Ferrari definitely has that whole stallion image going with it yeah but there's another reason a pop culture reason Miami Vice this is the car that they drove in Miami Vice or at least one of the sports cars we drove but that show vaulted this car to a whole new level and all of a sudden everybody had to have the same car that Don Johnson was driving in Miami Vice it was basically for those of you unfamiliar with Miami Vice it was a couple of undercover cops who are narcs narcotics officers trying to break into the Miami drug scene and bring him down okay and they posed as drug dealers and they drove around in a Ferrari so that was kind of the gist of the movie or the well I guess they did make a movie of it but the series Okay so sports cars became big it became commonplace to see Exotics everywhere you can go down to your local coffee shop and see a Ferrari outside you could go to the grocery store and see a whole bunch of Porsche 911s in the parking lot you can see those all over the place everywhere you went they had much more presents in the 80s then they even do today today you might see a nice car every now and then you go down to Orange County to see a few more but it wasn't like that back then you saw him a lot is that a sports cars wherever you were okay another big thing that's going on is the rising electronics Industry through the 50s and 60s has started to really really boom and all of that came out of Stanford Stanford is where the microchip was invented that's why Silicon Valley is where it is today it built up around Stanford because that's where the people who knew about microchips were located and today it's still there Silicon Valley is in Northern California the new electronics bring some new consumer things that you take for granted today and one of them as mentioned before is this the dine attack 8000x now prior to this people in the 80s were putting cellular phones in their cars but having a truly portable one wasn't really a reality until this model and only really would buy this now this shot here of Michael Douglas talking on that that's from the movie Wall Street and basically it was a movie about Wall Street Traders who started embracing insider trading which became a big scandal in the 80s as well and then the whole system kind of came down collapsing well he was known for his excess he was one of those hyper-consuming people and here he is on the beach talking on his dynotech 8000x what is the nickname of this phone does anybody know the brick good yes this became known as the prick you see this that's a pretty big phone isn't it that's the small battery the big one took it out to about there only about 2 hours of standby so still not exactly practical in truth the first truly practical cell phone was the Motorola flip phone you guys know that one right I have one I bought it back then and I used it back then it was a great phone it would fit in your pocket even with the extended battery it would still it would be a bulge but it would still fit in your pocket but that was really the first truly practical cell phone that became available to a Master group everybody started buying those and then technology got better the Sloan's got Capone's got smaller easier to fit in various places some would be flip phones some would be regular phones and then they will go to a whole new level now other things that take off in consumer electronics video games this is pong you guys have heard upon yeah it's it's sort of like playing tennis back and forth you just hit this little dot back and forth between the paddles okay so hung okay this is going to date me I had pong when I was a kid and then I had to follow on the Atari 2600 and then I have to follow on the NES Nintendo Entertainment System yes I had I still have two of them go figure yeah hey rise to personalization of computer products yes it's a gaming platform but personal computers are also going to come out at the same time and Atari the creators of this pong game here are also one of the driving forces behind the rise of personal computers with the Atari 400 and the Atari 800 later on others will start getting in as well Radio Shack puts out their own version they have a their in-house brand Tandy and they put out the TRS 80 that is the Tandy Radio Shack model lady and it gets an unfortunate name the trash lady yeah yeah he didn't really want one of those but meanwhile another computer company jumps into the foray and starts making a name for themselves Apple they come up with the apple one it is popular they come up with the Apple too it was incredibly popular then they came out with the two c and everybody loved it so that one's rising up in the PC World however it was IBM that really put this particular technology on the map how many of you have a a Mac today okay how many have a PC okay the PCS are still on this architecture the max are still on the macro architecture so this split that's going on here between Apple and IBM is still something that is a Mainstay in computer technology today now I have one of those too this is going to be kind of a walk down memory lane for me in a lot of ways I get to see my life as I get better technology along the way up team well by the late '80s I I respect to clean an adult I suppose I was in college and 89 so okay now initially the PCS had just floppy drives and they would usually have two of them but the pcxt was the first Model to incorporate that a hard drive oh my gosh it was big it was 10 MB you have music files bigger than that don't you yeah 10 MB is nothing today back then it was huge that was enormous that would you be able to put tons of programs and not have to load them in by floppies anymore just fire it up and accent wow this is great well 10 makes becomes 20 minutes and we're off vector graphics still not great and then came this Steve Jobs was one of the most brilliant people in Tech he was also a tyrant a dictator and it was rumored that he was that he had a drug problem too frequently take something to stay up for long periods of time he was known as somebody who would stay up for days on end and so some people thought he was amphetamines other people thought he was on coke but he definitely had the attitude problems to go with it okay and he would push his people relentlessly oftentimes they were pushed to work 18 20 24 hours straight without going home but ultimately he came out with this this changed everything the rise of McIntosh you know all those icons you have on your phones this is where they were created this is who invented them Steve Jobs he's the one who created all the stuff that we use today computers and phones all of it tablets he was the brainchild behind this stuff and Macintosh is where it started McIntosh created a system for computing that is still used today and yes I had one of those that's the one I took to college actually this is the Mac one I had the Mac plus the Mac plus had a little bit different configuration but it still looked a lot like that anyway like I said another big innovation that's coming out in the spare time cable cable television before this everybody had rabbit ears they're all trying to get the right reception and sometimes it just wasn't awesome well cable changed all that all of a sudden you don't have to have reception it always comes in clear and also there were channels on Cable that were available that you could not get over the air and cable is becoming more and more common one of the channels that made a big difference from a consumer standpoint is the way the music industry is presenting music they're not only giving you the audio they start including a visual component music videos and the channel MTV Music Television music videos were off and that early generation was actually really kind of fun videos kind of suck now but back then they were pretty interesting another one is all those people who are frustrated when they watch Network television and they put a movie out they saw in the theaters but they censor it and they cut out all the adult parts and they put in advertising everywhere and it just breaks up the movie and people go I just want the movie Let me see it well a company came along to deliver exactly that home box office HBO and when they couple that with the rising VCR technology that was becoming increasingly popular all of a sudden people are saying wow I can get HBO get an uncut movie the way it was shown in the theaters and recorded on my VCR I can have my own collection of movies at home no more of this commercials you can relate to that right yeah commercials are still something to bug us you don't want to be watching your movie and they say I'm falling and I can't get up yes this was a way for cable to bring more consumerism to America and Beyond the Cold War also influenced a lot of movies for example Firefox I knew Russian plane that changes everything in America is falling behind technology technologically so we have to send a spy over to steal the plane where are we behind technologically no we were actually quite a bit ahead but people believe that we were behind so this actually sold well now if you want to see something funny watch this movie it actually wasn't a bad movie on the storyline but if the part where they start flying the special effects are just awful it's like somebody's taking a plane bouncing it on the end of a stick wish frankly they probably work it just looks like it's bouncing up and down like this instead of just flying smoothly and so it just it doesn't look right technology be questioned what happens if computers become too smart what happens if AI takes over this is reflected in this one where a Matthew Broderick is a hacker who tries to play a game on a system he thinks is a gaming company and he actually in inadvertently gets a government computer playing a war game that tries to launch the missiles at the Soviet Union yikes and it doesn't know the difference between a game or real life so this suspicion of technology is something going along in this period of time too you probably have seen the Terminator or at least know the basics right same basic theme anti AI what happens if AI gets too smart and we become the bad guys ex machina you guys seen that movie that was out not that long ago maybe well in your lifetime at least another suspicion of AI Red Dawn you want to talk about unreal movies high school kids leader Rebellion against an invasion of the Soviet Union and Cuba of the United States and they inspire a big wave of resistance that ultimately Wyndham the War I buy that Patrick Swayze okay enough said Chuck Norris campy but played on Star Wars basically Dan and Aykroyd and Chevy Chase are recruited as would be spies they're actually decoys but their job is to go in there take control of a Russian missile fired at the United States reason they want to test their new shoot down the shoot down with the Laser Technology STI only problem they miss whoops now there's a nuclear missile heading in America you want to see what happens watch the movie This one is suddenly become relevant again hasn't it how many saw the new one it was good wasn't it it was actually a pretty good movie yeah but Continuum this is still something that's hanging around but it kind of gives you the impact of how Big Top Gun was Top Gun was one of the biggest movies to come out of the '80s it was very very popular this one was a disturbing movie Miracle Mile basically they found out that nuclear missiles from Russia had been launched they had about 45 minutes to live they are desperately trying to figure out if there's a way to stop it or place for people to get get the safety or a way to let people know that they need to take shelter and it's an exercise in futility the bombs start falling in everybody dies nice huh nuclear Holocaust and then Hunter probably won some of you have probably in it some point yeah okay well as we move a little bit more toward the current we move into the era of consumerism going to a whole new level the internet the advance of the internet was actually initially called artnet and artnett still exists aren't that was a computer lash up between the US government and defense contractors and some major universities that had defense research grants to develop new technology and stuff and they needed effective ways to talk to each other so our net became the basis of that well the people in the University said wow this is great man we could use something like this in the civilian world too we should be letting linking up University's and so they start doing that and that lash up is ultimately what will become the internet the internet quotes on a sea of units Unix is the operating system of the internet still is today if you look at the internet code on the big servers it's still units that's still the the protocols that they're using and ultimately it started with that will get taken up to a new level in 1995 and in 95 the internet as you know it today was born and the reason Microsoft came out with Windows 95 and with it came the World Wide Web the web was then established and from that point on you start getting websites everybody wanted to make their own website it was kind of fun I had a you know real basic one but everybody started learning HTML and learning how to put Graphics up and it was It was kind of fun it's a lot more sophisticated now but this was the start of it meanwhile in 1985 Apple had had enough of Steve Jobs and they fired him and then Apple just kind of went like this and they were getting ready to hit the bottom meanwhile Steve Jobs what does he do he starts a new computer company called next where he puts out a 32-bit computer Graphics that had not been seen before and an operating system that would run it very efficiently that was an incredible Leap Forward well eventually apple is going to say hey Steve come back but there was something else he did when he built those computers he also created a new company in Hollywood it would take computers and generate animation with them rather than doing it by hand the old Disney way it became known as Pixar he established Pixar and eventually he will sell it to Disney for $9 billion dollars and then he goes back to work for Apple when he goes to work for apple he says okay you want me back you have to buy my operating system from next because I intend to use it for the next generation of apples and they said deal that operating system that he wrote with next that he brought in was ox10 you know OS X for those of you who are in the Mac world that was what the operating system was it came out of that that was the one he built for next and it has been one of the most successful Apple operating systems in history Apple had a big Resurgence first he brought out these IMAX so the Macintosh took up to a new level then he started putting out laptops how many of you have a MacBook but this this is the one that really saved Apple bacon this is the one that brought them back up to the Forefront the iPod not only could you put individual songs on there however you want it you can put 5,000 songs on there you weren't limited it would play them all how many of you have an iPod today yeah they stop selling them in like 2017-2018 somewhere in there but people still have them and they still use them although these work like iPods too now and that was by Design the next evolution the iPhone we have Steve Jobs to thank for these whether you have an Apple iPhone or some other smartphone that was the Legacy and what has that meant for Consumer America this is the most powerful consumer technology that has ever been made you can reach out and buy whatever you want with this you can you want to buy a car you can do it you want to buy anything log on to Amazon try to find something they don't carry if you can't find it there Google it you can find somebody selling it consumerism has never been more personal more on demand than it is right here anywhere you go you have a mall in your pocket or your purse or wherever you carry this thing it is an incredibly powerful tool buy stuff how many of you have used your phone to buy something in the last week me too Jason point this is modern consumers I've seen it go from the pre-internet world to embracing the internet to social media Facebook which I have an account specifically so that I don't have to use it I wanted to reserve it for myself and say no no if anybody trying to put up a fake account I'd say no this is my account they don't have it that's why I do it and I don't use it stay away from Facebook okay so that takes us up basically to the present you should have everything you need for the exam we will not meet next week this is our last meeting session so use next week have fun studying and preparing for whatever you have to and the final exam date is in the syllabus you will have all day and I'll probably send you out a reminder email as well okay I hope you had a great time I'll see you maybe next year</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/History%201460-04/","title":"History 1460 04","text":"<p>Special Thanks to Lucas

didn't hurt your arm yeah exam when is it next Monday do you show up no okay good we should finish off the rest of the religious materials today so you should have everything you need now where we left off last time did we talk about Heaven's Gate I kind of mentioned in passing Jim Jones right that's kind of where we stopped yeah Jim Jones and peoples Temple that is going to be the subject of the extra credit paper assignment so if you if you open the paper assignment there is a link to the film actually in the assignment itself you click on that link it'll bring it up and you can watch it on the internet so that should make it very easy for you so I would encourage you all to do the extra credit you don't have to it's optional but it is quite a few points so it's it's worth doing okay there were a number of Fringe religious movements that that really began in the 60s and '70s and the time kind of catered to that there were a lot of people who were looking for answers and some were looking in unusual places and so you'll see people gravitate towards some of these more Fringe ideas and we talked about some of the people getting interested in Eastern religions and how some of them became even a little bit more extreme like in 51 rajnisho in his movement but I want to talk today about another Fringe movie before we get to that one let's mention Heaven's Gate Heaven's Gate is an interesting group to look at they are technically a Christian Splinter Group although they deviated quite a bit from that basically Heaven's Gate was originally founded in 1975 by a man named Marshall Applewhite and the group was called total Overcomers Anonymous however they found that that sounded more like a rehab group than a religion than a religious movement so they will later change that to Heaven's Gate Heaven's Gate basically was a combination of Science Fiction and religious ideals Marshall Applewhite basically told his followers that he was the return of Jesus he is Jesus come back to earth and that when Jesus was here the first time couldn't reveal his true self to people because they wouldn't have understood at the time but now they would and that is that he was an alien he was from outer space another planet and he came on a spaceship and when Jesus was crucified ultimately that allowed his Spirit to go back to the Mothership and go home so that he can come back later and return and bring loyal followers back with him Marshall have a wife says Jesus has returned and guess who he was he was told he was followers as though d o and that's specifically is the top of the tone dough you know like Do Re Mi so it's a musical song the kind of people he attracted were people who were honestly nerds the people there all encourage conformity men and women dressed alike they had the same basic haircut androgyny was sort of the name of the game here you it didn't really matter whether somebody was a male or female they all look the same they all wore the same outfits they were these you seen those like silver exercise suits from like the 80s the people wore it was kind of like hey look I'm like the astronauts I'm like NASA yeah I can dress in that shiny silver jumpsuit just like the astronauts do well that's what they kind of wore they wore those sort of exercise suits that were bright silver and they all wore exactly the same kind of shoes Nike's all the same kind of Nikes they all had the same haircut have you guys seen Star Trek you know Mr Mr spot okay they all had spot haircuts they were basically prototypically Vulcans that's what they look like they look like the Vulcans from Star Trek and they talked and approached things the same way they were people who were more or less looking for some kind of connection however well in 1975 is when it was started the movement ended in the late 90s and it ended rather tragically 1997 saw something really cool happen yeah most of you probably weren't born yet I'm guessing in 97 does anybody alive in 97 one do you remember 1997 there was something cool that happened that year the hail bought comet came within sight of Earth the hilltop comment was not like Haley's coming Haley's comment you needed a telescope to see but you can get a good view of it when it did come in into view the hailbox you could actually see with the naked eye he did not need a telescope to see it that's what made it so cool you could actually look up and see the comment up there in the sky and it's like a little whisper there but you can see it and that gave him the visual he was waiting for he says see that comment my shift is here my shift is hiding in the tail of the hellbot comment and the reason is because technology on Earth has advanced enough to where they would be able to see my spaceship and so it has to stay hidden so it's hiding in that Comet but when it comes within range of Earth we need to release our true inner selves and join with the mothership and the way we do that is to get rid of these prisons that are locking us here the flesh is the prison and ultimately over a three-day period 39 people will commit suicide down in Rancho Santa Fe which is a community outside of San Diego now total total Overcomers anonymous had established itself early on and I think Oregon but they moved to a bunch of different places they moved to Canada they moved to Colorado they moved all over the place but they were forming one of these religious communities just like some of the other movements we talked about well at this point in time that communion was down in Rancho Santa Fe outside of sand San Diego 39 people will ultimately commit suicide they were very distinctive in that they were all they all died in bunk beds they look like military bunk beds in this place and all of them had a purple scarf over there upper torso in their face so they all had that they all had to go back next to their their physical body why would they need to go bag can all of their bags had exactly the same things in them and they were in there in exactly the same way they're all packed identically so Nikes and some other stuff were you know socks that were folded a certain way and placed in there a certain way all their stuff was in those bags so they were preparing for their Journey and then they committed suicide group The Heaven's Gate religious community they were a strange a strange Fringe group there was another group I want to talk about that was also a French group and similar to some of the others that we've discussed earlier they had a connection with some of the other influences as well for example The Beatles another group religiously and this group was headed up by somebody who was a born Criminal his name was Charles Manson heard of him Charles Manson was a criminal from the time he was a small child he started out ripping off candy from the local 7-Eleven and pretty soon he will Branch out to other things he will be in and out of juvenile hall throughout his childhood he will actually end up spending far more time in his life behind bars in detention then he will outside so more of his life is spent under somebody else's control when he got out and he was in his early holidays his early teens 12:13 to cartel he started boosting cars by the time he had gotten out and come back he had been raped in juvenile hall as a boy and he didn't learn the lesson that most people learn from race rape is bad rape can give you a great deal of power and control over somebody else he looks at rapes as a way to control other people seven and said your honor I don't want to leave I feel more comfortable here behind bars this is home for me I don't feel comfortable out in the world you should leave me in here and he said sorry Mr Manson that's not the way things work we have to Turn You Loose he gets out and he goes to where all the action is in the late sixties Berkeley Berkeley is the protest Center of America really the protest center of the world if you're upset about race relations you go to Berkeley if you're upset about the Vietnam War you go to Berkeley you're upset about the women's movement and women not having the rights to men do you go to Berkeley whatever your cause if you want to protest that's the protest capital of the world so the whole sex drugs in rock and roll scene was centered in Berkeley that's where people went the free love movement was in Berkeley the free drugs movement was in Berkeley everything was centered there and so when he gets out in 67 that's where he goes he locates in a section of Berkeley called the hate Ashbury District that's basically a cross street hate and Ashbury this is the area of the most activist the most extreme rebellion in Berkeley that's where you find it if you want to find people who are doing drugs that's where you go if you want to find people who have weird ideas about everything that's where you go this is the mecca for people who want to experience protesting and that's where he centers and it doesn't take him long before people start listening to him on drugs talking about all of the ideas now keep in mind dianetics is a very thick and heady book there's a lot of complex ideas in it and Charles Manson his only education really came within the prison system when he was out of prison he wasn't going to school he was committing crime when he is in prison that's when he gets the limited education that he has so don't think of him as a mental giant he may read this and interpret it a certain way but that doesn't mean he's understanding it for what it is he twist things around a lot but after you've had a lot of drugs his ideas start to sound really far out it's amazing how drugs will do that to you things that would sound completely crazy suddenly sound amazingly genius and he becomes known as a local Guru people start coming in hearing Charlie talk about things famous people start rubbing elbows with him he meets actors from Hollywood who are coming up there because it was cool to protest he met musicians who are coming up there he knew the Beatles he said down with John Lennon and hung out with them he became convinced that John Lennon was a prophet and then his songs were actually prophecy that he was writing that he didn't even know his own greatness but he was convinced that Lennon was a prophet he started being obsessed with Beatles music and he listened to it endlessly he listened to the song Yellow Submarine have you guys know that song for those of you who don't know it it kind of goes on and on and on and it's it's one of those songs that's kind of like you know 100 bottles of beer you know it just keeps going and and circling it's it's like a circular song well he starts listening to that song for hours on end one time after another after another looking for the hidden meanings and he does that with other Beatles songs too eventually it comes to the song Helter Skelter and when he gets to that song he says that's it that's the one he recognizes the prophecy of Lenin and says that's the song Helter Skelter and Charlie believes that he is the person who is chosen to introduce this prophecy into the world Helter Skelter he says Helter Skelter what is it it's a war that's coming where humanity is going to reinvent itself out of the ashes of its own complacency he says the world is going to all go to war all at the same time everyone everywhere and National boundaries are not going to matter it isn't about Nations it's about races this is going to be a race war the different races of the world are going to go to war with each other they're going to compete and he says blacks are going to win this war but as it comes time to rule everything they are going to fail not because they don't have the capability of ruling but because they don't have the experience they have been the victims of being ruled by others for so long that they don't know how to do it themselves so they're ultimately going to fail at it and then the whole world is going to fall into chaos it's going to come apart and a fragment of humanity Will Survive what comes and they will rebuild Society out of that that is helter skilled that is the idea that he's pushing sounds same yeah he's out there well he's out there he meets a lot of famous people and he comes to realize that his real influence is calling him to Southern California the entertainment industry the people that he has met the famous people musicians actors and what not they are located more in Southern California so he wants to relocate cell to be with the people that he has made these connections with he and his followers who have become to call themselves The Family later on others will call them the Manson family but they called himself the family they will follow Manson down he will buy an old dilapidated school bus and it's painted like psychedelic colors which was something big for the '60s they all did that and they will drive down from Northern California to Southern they start looking around for a place to live the problem is they don't really have any money they don't have jobs they don't they don't really have anything and he finds out that Dennis Wilson one of the Beach Boys is renting a place out in Malibu so he hooks up with Dennis Wilson and says hey my friends and I need a couple days to stay somewhere until we can find a place to live can we can we hang out with you and Dennis figures yeah sure why not he was kind of cool sure I'll do that it doesn't take Dennis Wilson all that long before he realizes that Charlie isn't cool the Charlie is insane and violent and dangerous and frankly he gets rather afraid of him he's looking for a reason to kick Manson out but it does not take him long before he realizes Manson ain't leaving he's moved into the home and he has no intention of moving out well fortunately there's two things going for Dennis Wilson one he's a musician and musicians go on tour and two the place is only being rented he doesn't own it so he talks to his brother Brian who was also in the Beach Boys and says hey Brian can you get a couple more dates schedule a couple more dates at the beginning of the tour let's get out of here early this guy scares the hell out of me and I want to get out of here and Brian says don't worry about it I'll take care of it so they schedule a couple more days to get them on the road earlier and Dennis Wilson basically says okay Charlie I got to go on tour with Beach Boys and you're free to live here as long as you want the the rent paid up till the end of the month after that you're on your own but feel free to stay here for the rest of the month bye and boom he's gone which is next to Malibu he goes back up in the hills where there is this Old Ranch and it's run by a man named George Fawn George spawn is 80 something years old and the ranch is dilapidated it's falling apart it was used in a lot of western movies so it was a movie set but now it has seen better days and he clearly can't keep the place up so Charles Manson gets the idea hey George if we agree to help you fix up the place and take care of the things that need to be taken care of will you let us stay here for free you know we're we're perfectly willing to work that work for our rent but you know we're having a hard time finding a place to live if you let us do that we'll take care of this place for you and George says sure why not so he makes that deal and they actually do that they do work to try to fix the place up a bit meanwhile Manson goes to his most loyal follower a woman named Lynette and says I want you to keep George happy now George is in his 80s okay so keeping him happy doesn't really involve too much you know this is the pre Viagra days so you know yeah perfect timing right so so basically it amounts to flirting with him keep him happy flirt with him and she does and he likes to play a little game where he'd come up and surprise her and picture on her back side and she'd make this squeaky little sound and he started calling her squeaky and the name stuck remember this because Lynette AKA squeaking is going to become important later so they're up there and spawn Ranch and he's looking for the opportunity to sit Helter Skelter in motion he wants to do it so he starts looking around for the opportunity and he gets an idea I know how we can get visibility we will attack the house of somebody famous and kill everybody there and that'll get us in front of the cameras and that'll allow me to start Helter Skelter that's what he wants shock value so he finds out that Roman Polanski a director who was famous by that point he had directed a very disturbing movie that nonetheless was famous by that point it was called Rosemary's Baby it's about a woman who more or less has the baby of the devil gives birth to the Antichrist anyway he becomes famous for this creepy movie and he has a wife a young actress beautiful woman named Sharon Tate who is eight months pregnant now he is on a movie shoot out in Europe so he's not in country but Sharon he doesn't just abandon her he makes sure that she has people around her that will help take care of her in in all of this time when the time comes that she has the baby he'll come back out and spend some time with her she is with three friends won't you frykowski is one of her is one of his friends from Poland they were both from the the country out in Europe and both of them worked in Hollywood so he was helping him out also JC bring which was Sharon's ex-boyfriend and was still her hair dresses it was Hollywood and then a friend of hers probably your best friend at the time a woman named Abigail Folger as in Folgers Coffee Culture yeah she was an Eros so these are the three people who are hanging out with her and Manson says I want you to go into that home and he selects four of his followers this is I want you to go into that home and kill everybody there come back to me when it's done so four of them approach this place now the house is surrounded by a wall and it has a front security gate kind of thing and they go okay so they cut the phone lines and they start scaling the wall only to see a young man 18 years old coming out the front door his name is Steven's parents Steven parents is a pizza delivery boy he was in the wrong place at the wrong time and Steven so sorry you're about to die Steven parent becomes the first person killed by Manson's followers they say well we can't have him turning loose the alarm letting them know that something is up so we have to take care of him kill him now so they kill him and then immediately charge into the home now one of them has a gun Charles Watson he goes by text Charles Watson is the only person with the gun the rest of them have state knives only he has a gun so they're not really all that prepared for this when they go in they see the four people there and they start tying them up and they are very very rough with Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring says hey she's pregnant 8 months you know he's up you're being really rough with her maybe you should let her sit on the couch or something text Watson shoots jcbrink kills him at that point would you break the direction this is going he sees an empty window and open window rather and says okay I'm going for it he starts taking off running for the window Watson goes after him and shoots it what would you cry then get back up and starts running some more he shoots it again he falls down gets up and starts running some more you just can't stop him he just keeps going and finally watching runs after him and tackles him and when he's on the ground he stabs him a bunch of times and would you cry gets up and tries to start running again now he's been stabbed who knows how many times and he's been shot twice and he's still getting up and trying to run he's tackled again and ultimately Watson will stab him a total of 51 times and shoot him twice before he finally dies yikes meanwhile while all this is going on Abigail Folger sees the Direction all this is going she sees that everybody's distracted with troikowski who just jumped out the window she picks a different window and goes for it and two of the three women who are still in the house chase after her only armed with steak knives they track her down they tackle her and they start stabbing her with the steak knives she is ultimately stabbed a total of 28 times before she dies and finally there's only Sharon Tate left she's the only one left alive they come in she's not going anywhere she's 8 months pregnant and she's tied up what is she going to do so they get to take their time making sure that they kill her right they stab her until almost 16 times a number of them are chest wounds but they are also stabbing her in the abdomen they are deliberately killing the baby they want to make sure both of them died they go back to Charlie and say okay it's done and Manson hears about how absolutely fumbled this whole thing was and he says this is ridiculous you guys are a bunch of incompetence I need to go along and make sure you do this right next time and so he says okay you guys are going to go into another house tomorrow and I'm going to go with you in the supervised to make sure you do it right and that will ultimately become the lobby so another set of murders happens now do they cover up evidence no they're not interested in covering up evidence they want to be caught why Manson is giving up public defender whose name is Ronald Hughes he tries to go for an insanity please they don't take it they want to go for the death penalty and Charles Manson I don't really care what you do so long as you put me on the stand Ronald Hughes knows there's no way he could give Charlie a legitimate legal defense if he were to put Charles Manson on the stand no sane lawyer would do that so he refuses and doesn't put Charles Manson on the stand Manson and several of his followers are convicted of the various murders and sentenced to the death penalty sentence to gas following the handing down of the sentences Ronald hughes's found killed and laid in a ditch face down so the remaining members of the family killed it he never got his time in front of the camera now one of the people who is still at large one of the people who was not implicated in the murders was none other than Lynette from squeaky I told you she would come back and Lynette wants to give Charles her his time in front of the cameras he wants to make sure that Charles gets the chance to start Helter Skelter I need to do something so big there's no way they can ever keep that camera out from his face he needs to get in front of the camera what can I do that would be that extreme and she has an idea she's going to kill the president of the United States that's her idea president of the United States time was Gerald Ford and so she does some investigating as to when Ford is going to be out in the public shaking hands and she plans to be there so she goes after DC with a gun that she purchases she has the gun and she is not exactly the kind of person who just blends she stands out she has flaming red hair correctly you guys ever see the Snoopy cartoons she kind of looks like Peppermint Patty okay she is a person who's born to stand out people notice her and far from trying not to stand out she dresses in a bright red outfit Scarlett bright red with a goofy stupid looking hat now this is a person who stands out how the Secret Service ever let her get within range of the president is beyond me he's practically screaming I'm here to kill the president did she gets about this far from the president holds up the gun and start pulling the trigger it didn't go off she gets tackled by the Secret Service and she's sitting there swearing under this pile of bodies I didn't know if it didn't go off it didn't go off as she's being hauled off with cuff she's laughing at the people taking pictures of her it didn't go off the gun didn't go off yeah yeah there are a couple different types of guns revolvers if she had bought a revolver Ford would be dead but she bought an automatic no automatics are good weapons as a matter of fact there's an extra safety features with automatics that revolvers don't have namely you have to chamber around before you can pull the trigger that's an extra added safety measure well she didn't realize that she bought a gun she loaded it and she took it and tried pulling the trigger it didn't go off why she didn't chamber the round like I said Ford was still alive because he was stupid around she was pointing right in his heart she got the trigger pulled several excuse me several times before Secret Service dropped him or dropped herbs so yeah she failed she was put on trial but she accomplished what she was after the media went and talked to Charles Manson in prison and he got to talk about Helter Skelter and show just how completely insane he really was meanwhile Lynette prom went to prison for the attempted assassination of the president of the United States now the interesting thing is she wasn't sentenced to life in prison she got out in 2009 she now lives in Orange County sleep well she's out now in 1987 she actually broke out of prison she managed to get out and everybody starts freaking out oh my God she's going to go on a killings Corcoran State Prison where Charles Manson was she was trying to figure out how to get in to see him that's what she was trying to do they caught her a couple days later just before Christmas and put her back in prison so she got out in 2009 now the rest of them that were put in in prison text Watson came up for parole in 2016 parole was denied he is still they felt really should have been executed but they understand the Supreme Court struck down the death penalty statute that they quickly rewrote to fit the legal opinion but the damage has been done and they absolutely did not want these women getting out now involved in the tape murders they were involved in the lobby oncommer but the teeth family was the one out in front why them their daughters the thing so people see them in a way that they wouldn't necessarily see the lobby on so they came out and pushed the case for everyone should not go keep them in the parole board and already recommended their release so they were said to be released at that point there's only one person who can stop Jerry Brown was faced with the decision what do I do he yanked it no parole for these two they stand so the Tate's Lobby women but period people were dealing with failure on a widespread basis they lost a war American history they lost the war now America lost 65, 000 soldiers in that war the Vietnamese lost 2 million people and they still won this war 2 million dead so many died people aren't feeling very good about the country what's more their national leaders they don't trust Nixon lied to them a number of ways and then tried to rig a presidential election he ended up resigning to avoid getting isn't it come up to a trial in the Senate he would have been kicked out he would have been the first president ever to have space death after he resigns President Ford hardened him pretty much guarantee that nobody would vote for Ford in the reelection news what's wrong with this country economically the 70s were a disaster we were in the midst of the oil crisis we had back Israel in the 1973 on the pro war and OPEC had embargoed oil against the United States caught the massive oil story with Atlantic huge gas line and all kinds of problems in America I remember as a kid activity drop the 70s in 1976 they want somebody who is religiously about to be depressed they're looking for somebody who is quality person ever elected in the presence now that doesn't mean he was the best president he had a combination of really bad luck things out of his control and some bad decisions on his part and how to deal with prices when he was getting submerged with them depended to pull inside the White House and deal with the crisis rather than he seen getting out in front of it meaning from the front and the American people it look like the crisis were piling up on him and he just couldn't handle political activist group they were trying to worry about political activism based on their religious ideas they were led by a southern baptist who creature named Jerry Obama who made a lot of controversial for the cause later on Jerry Falwell and the moral majority in the face of justice and not everybody likes that face there was a push for equal rights and a new constitutional amendment was proposed of the people right for men it almost became an amendment it failed and ratification by only a couple States but it almost got me shut it up and he came out very outspoken against him men and women are not equal but at the same time women get more Advantage out of not being equal then they do if they worry they've got a good they just don't know it so all the advantages that they happen again as well 1972 Landmark decision in other words you all know that recently roaming Wade was struck down and now there are speeds that are starting to Outlaw abortion again so we are returning to that he came out very strongly against abortion he says apportion should be illegal under any circumstance people say it should be illegal in the case of break or to save the mother's life he says that you need to be leaving for that it should be banned all the time another thing that the new America's military dominance in America used to be a great country because we were strong the reason we emerged from World War II as a world leader is because we had a strong military and any attempt to weaken that military therefore he imposed any kind of limitations of his weapons in other words nuclear weapons there were a lot of nuclear production treaties official religion of the United States and then reinstitute school program he wants to eliminate the device in both parties more people on the conservative side respond in support of them and so it's the Republican party it ends up getting the big Resurgence and support of of protestant Christianity did not like it he was the most definitely a southerner he was very outspoken about segregation wasn't the state Never Back here's a direct quote ishment homosexuals it's not punishment for the society that tolerance subtract from that thing reputation beyond all measure was the conflict he had with Hustler magazines publisher Larry Flynn Larry Flint the publisher hustle magazine is a pornography he's somebody who's putting out dirty and although constantly was going out for censorship was something that America should have when it came to you 2010 to Boulder anti-family material like pornography so he was very antiverse people in the media are saying well I don't really like customer magazine I couldn't stop drinking and it was a Sunday morning I went completely Blaster and gave my service insurance and then when I got home from church and he said hello had sex with his mother in and out now stress and the ability to suppress Free Press and ultimately the Supreme Court comes down Larry plant and his magazine and his magazine has every every right to attack him back his position trying to back towards HW Bush in his presidency presidential in religious political activism is that gone no you take a look at the political climate now and that Resurgence of the new right is still very active in fighting this war back and forth and religion is right here at the center the heart of the battle against how you come down on things so this is something

That's usually about where they tax The Peasants at it's about 60%, but they just had a war so now they're texting him at 80% so the peasants have only this much to stay alive instead of the whole amount and that can be really problematic now if you are a king and you need more tax income you can only push the peasantry just so far before they break so how do you get more taxes if you are the king if you tax land what do you have to do you have to get more land okay how do you get more land if you are a country you have to conquer so you go to your neighbor and you try to slice off that much of their land and as a result throughout the feudal period you have a constant state of one country going to war with another in order to try to get a piece of their land if you take a look at the Roman Empire the Roman Empires are really good example of this they would expand but then they'd have to pay for their Wars with more taxes well they ran out of people to tax the people are already pushed to their limit so the only thing that they can do is expand they take over more land the problem is by the time they have conquered this land that would have meant their old expenses but now you have another War to pay for so suddenly you have even higher expenses which means you have to go to war with somebody else and take that much land but then again by the time you get this you only have enough to pay for the expenses there so you have to stay in a constant state of expansion as soon as you stop expanding your Empire will fall apart that was the problem with Rome that's the big weakness with land-based Empires now it was bad enough when people fought Wars with swords and armor if you have a sword do you have to replace it every time you have another War yes no what do you think will this sword kill somebody 200 years from now will that work assuming you keep the rust off sure the sword all you have to do is make sure it's sharp it'll kill okay but what happens when they start getting into gunpowder base weapons the technology is constantly changing and every time the the stuff changes before when you have swords you had Spears you had stuff like that you didn't have to replace your weapons every time you had a war you can just use the same old ones you have but now Warfare has changed and every time they go to war they're going to war with increased technology and if something changes to throw the balance off between you and your and you and your opponents then all of a sudden you have to replace not just the broken weapons the few weapons along the way you have to replace all of the weapons and that becomes incredibly expensive so basically Warfare is becoming too expensive for this for this system to survive so when they go colonizing they're looking for financial resources Spain finds them now what is Spain actually looking for when they go exploring the world what is it the Portugal got do you guys remember they're not Portugal doesn't find gold Portugal goes after China they're trying to get the Chinese tree and China is kind of The Big Brass Ring in the sky they've got silk they've got all kinds of great products if you can monopolize the trade with China you're doing great so Portugal goes after that Spain sees the Portugal cut off the Eastern route and they try to find an alternate route they say well all we have to do is go west and we'll hit China did they well if they went far enough they would have but instead they run into the Americas they didn't know that they were there so that's Columbus when they get there however they say well we found something new maybe we should look around a bit and lo and behold that's when they realize the Aztecs have all these plates made of gold interesting possibility and they start looking around and lo and behold there's gold and silver all over the places that they go into Mexico lots of gold and silver Peru largest Silver Mine ever located in the entire world was in Peru and the Spanish got a hold of it okay so the Spanish are finding gold and silver they end up being a cash Rich Empire they have lots of money and that money can help fuel future colonization England however is not a cash rich country they need money they don't have a lot they've been drained down over the years so they don't have a lot of money to pay for expeditions and when colonization starts there they initially want to go looking for golden silver they want what's Spain hats they want that gold and silver so they come make a landing where do they land Virginia is there golden Virginia nope silver no Cole they got cold in Virginia that doesn't do them any good though they need money so they start looking around say well shoot what can we use here and it was there that John Roth we talked about him establishing the tobacco economy okay so they start growing hash props it's not gold or silver but it is trade activity and there England figures out well maybe this is a solution to the problem after all why their taxes before were based on what land production agriculture but now they're saying maybe there's something else we can tax what if we encourage people to buy and sell stuff we can tax transactions we can tax trade and so they start taxing trade that's going on that's where they'll end up getting their money from so they're not getting it from golden silver they're trying to get it from trade but here's the rough okay here's England over here and then the colonies over here the colonies initially are growing tobacco okay so let's use tobacco as the good really it's any of the trade goods that are producing the cash crops don't think of the cash crops necessarily is agriculture instead think of them as growing economic products there a product to sell they're not eating what they're producing they are using it in a different way okay so the tobacco they're selling over here now here's the problem remember when I said England is cash for when they start selling tobacco what happens where's the money going the money doesn't go to England if the tobacco goes to England which way does the money go it goes this way it has to pay for the tobacco right so all the people buying tobacco are paying money that direction in England suddenly is worried that all of their money supply is going to leave the country and they're going to have a trouble getting it back so they adopt a new economic system that will emerge out of this and transition England out of feudalism they're going to move into a different type of system now what is an economy that is based on trade a trade based economy what do we call that a market economy okay what is a market economy what type of economic system this word capitalism there it is capitalism we are shifting toward capitalism but capitalism is not the first step the first step is sort of in between capitalism is free trade the government is not supposed to touch the economic system in a free trade economy let the market adjust itself that's the whole idea behind a free trade economy that's what capitalism is and if they did not come up with the mercantilis system it would have what is the Mercantile system that mercantilism they see this relationship Happening Here the colonies are sending raw materials and they're getting paid for them so the money is leaving the country they want to get the money back taxes will get some of it but they're not really interested in some of it they want the bulk of it coming back to England how do you get the bulk of the money coming back to England what's that okay you can get them to move but more people are going to the colonies than coming out so the colonies are starting to grow if the money is starting to concentrate here how do you get money out of that you sell you self you say okay let's get these people to buy stuff we have to encourage them to purchase stuff if we can sell products to them then the money products going that way finish Goods then the money will come back to England so they say okay that works we can get economic stimulation by saying okay the raw materials we get from the colonies but then we sell them finish good so the colonies essentially become a Marketplace to buy all of the products that England starts making kind of the problem with this is the mentality behind it what do I mean by that in order to start selling products they have to change the dialogue England has to reinvent itself essentially out here they have a class system the aristocracy is up here everybody else is belong they're commoners now the commoners are broken up into different classes as well you have the middle class the merchant class you have the peasantry down below and you even have surfs although by this point serfdom has been outlawed it's gotten rid of it so basically you have the aristocracy and everyone else and the lines are very firm you don't just change class in England what you are born into is what you say very little classmobility is possible but the colonies are a different story you can come over and indentured servant and one day get your own property and even become wealthy is upward Mobility possible there absolutely so here is an opportunity for anyone to try to change their life to make it better class Mobility the aristocracy doesn't want to hear class Mobility they like things staying as they are especially the king that's how the king ensures stability and so what happens here is when they create this economy where they need people to buy stuff you have to start feeding people's egos you know why I say that why their egos have to get how did people determine whether they needed to buy something or not do I need food I'll buy it do I need housing I'll buy it do I have a genuine need a survival basic that I have to purchase I'll buy it once didn't matter what you want you don't buy what you want you buy what you need all of that changes they have to start saying hey you know you want to buy this this will make your life a little better stuck in this class you're feeding the mentality of the individual you're using the language of the Enlightenment the language of the Enlightenment says you have individual rights the king doesn't want you to have individual rights the king wants him to have rights and everybody else to do what they're told the people the commoners are cogs in the machine the only people in a feudal system that matter are the earthy but now they're encouraging a system where people are giving into their desires they're feeding their ego they're feeding that sense of individuality they're saying you want this by it this is going to cause a change all of a sudden people are not just going to buy what they need they're going to start buying what they want and the more you buy what you want suddenly people get this sense of self that they didn't have before this sense that hey what I want matters what I want is important and suddenly they want more the more they get the more they want the more they want the more they will try to get that do you see the seeds of Revolution being planted here that's what's happening and the King knows it this is dangerous dangerous ground for the king to go to and so he's nervous about putting in a free trade economy where he has no control over it so what mercantilism actually is is not free trade it's controlled at any given time the king can say no we have purchased enough tobacco we're not going to sell we're not going to buy anymore tobacco this year reason being he's seeing too much money leaving England so he can say stop exporting the money we need the money here now so quit selling product from the colonies quit buying product from the colonies stop that trade the king can stop it well here's the problem with consumer goods we all like our stuff don't we you guys know it's stuff is I look around the room and see stuff I'll look at my own pockets and see stuff stop stop all kinds of stuff we've all got it and here's the rub once you start feeding that buying consumer goods is addicting you become reliant on them and the more you have the more you want it's something that escalates so these people are starting to encourage them to buy stuff well now they are buying stuff but in order to buy stuff they have to be able to sell stuff now they're thinking hey my wife wants that new table that she's been bugging me for for the last 2 years with this Harvest of tobacco I can get it for for Christmas I just have to sell my tobacco and so the guys been working hard he fills his Warehouse full of tobacco getting it ready to export Here Comes October he's about ready to fill the ship and the King says no more tobacco this year I've got a warehouse full of this stuff and I want to buy my wife that new table my kid wants the GI Joe with the Kung Fu grip I got to get them what they want and in order to get them what they want I need to sell my stuff I need to be able to sell the tobacco the king can stop that well if you are addicted to stuff what are you going to do yeah you're going to sell it illegally you're going to run around the patrols and sell that stuff there's a word for that smuggling America is a country that was founded on smuggling you guys heard of John Hancock he's famous for his gigantic signature right you know what he signed so incredibly big that he's famous for that what was that signature on that made him famous to the president Declaration of Independence yeah you know why he wanted to sign it big enough he said that he wanted the king to be able to read his name from the other side of the ocean that's why he signed it so big reason being They confiscated his s because he was smuggling John Hancock Patriot Smuggler extraordinaire smuggling was basically the closet industry of America if you owned a ship I guarantee you have dabbled in smuggling you just did at some point or another somebody's going to want trade goods illegally when the king says stop the trade you're not going to stop you're going to keep going so you're looking for other ways to make that money mercantilism was a problematic system from the start however it does open the door for the transition toward capitalism now early on there was a problem you see Spain because they were getting all this golden silver the king have lots of money that they're digging out is money they just coin it no problem so the king of Spain has lots of money to sponsor other colonization that makes sense right get all that gold and silver you can pay for more sure problem is England that is already cashed for is dealing with a king or at this particular point of queen Queen Elizabeth that doesn't have a lot of money she can't pay for all of these Colonial expeditions the first real attempt by Britain to colonize was done by Sir Walter Raleigh he tries to set up the Colony of Roanoke well he does set up the Colony of Roanoke the problem is he left to get supplies and well there's a lot of intrigue in there and really this gives you a good look into some of these behind the scenes things that happened but basically Sir Walter Raleigh got delayed for a couple years before he can go back and bring the supplies that they needed it was 2 years before he got back there and by the time he got back there was nobody left in the settlement all he found was the word croatoa carved into a tree the croatoans were a native American group so they didn't know if that meant that croatoan's attacked them and wiped them out or if they became so desperate that they went and joined the croatoans and started Living with them all they know is they never found out what happened to Roanoke it went poop and when it disappeared Sir Walter Raleigh who sunk his entire family fortune into that expedition lost everything lost it all he was broke now and so colonization became a high risk Venture yeah there was a possibility for a lot of profit if it paid out but for him it ruined him financially and others are saying you know I don't really want to take that chance to try to limit the risk so one person doesn't have to put up the entire Fortune themselves instead they can sell bits and pieces of the company to different people what do we call that what's that marketing kind of stop okay yeah this is this is selling stock so this is an early version of a corporation they called it a joint stock company but to say that it is a corporation is not quite accurate it's close if functions similarly but this is a controlled trade economy and a corporation is a free trade mechanism you see the problem you can't really regulate it under that system so when they are coming up with the joint stock company the king knows that in order for this thing to work they have to be allowed to do things on their own they can't really be cut off the way you can cut off trade from others that is a lot of risk to take if you are the king and so in order to form a joint stock company it's not like a corporation is today if you want a corporation can you go get one fill out paperwork pay the fees you got a corporation congratulations go make money but back then if you wanted a joint stock company you had to get it from one of two ways either Parliament had to Grant it to you by passing a law that created it an act of parliament to create a joint stock company or the king could establish it through a royal Charter those were the only two ways you could create a joint stock company because once you did that company can operate more or less on its own it didn't need to respond to the crown very much they had a lot of independent freedom and that's not something that the king really wanted to give a lot of no matter how much good they might provide when they go back to Virginia and try again with Jamestown it was a joint stock company that was funding The Venture the Virginia Company likewise when the pilgrims go to Plymouth they formed the Plymouth Company which was also a joint stock company so now this is become England's method of funding those Ventures joint stock company the whole idea is you can split up the risk but it means you also split the reward between whoever owns it to okay what ends up happening because of the Mercantile system is consumerism in America catches on the people in the colonies take to consumerism like a fish to water they live it they breathe it they love it consumerism is great they have an instant demand for consumer goods and the more people are making money the more they will demand more consumer goods huge demand for it the consumer build up at this point turns into what becomes known as the consumer Revolution the consumer Revolution simply put is replacing the old system of how people bought the old system people buy what they need the new system people buy what they want what babe want based purchasing versus need based purchasing that is the revolution that's going on here Revolution is where one system is overturned and replaced with another one the consumer Revolution is where the basis of how people buy Goods changes so think about what that means here in America skyrocketing so much that the people who are making those products back in England can't keep up with the demand people are screaming for more Goods we want more stuff sell us more stuff and so the people back in England are going oh my gosh I'm making stuff night and day and I still can't keep up with their demand how do I do it they said well we're making products right now on an order by order basis we need to change that we need to come up with a way where we can make lots of products in less time so how do they do that they industrialize the Industrial Revolution starts in England that's where the worldwide Industrial Revolution starts it starts in England but it starts because of America the reason they start building factories is because the Americans are demanding so many consumer goods they have trouble keeping up with the demand so they're trying to make the production more efficient so the consumer Revolution creates the Industrial Revolution this will change the world America is changing the world as they go America will be the first enlightenment Revolution that will occur but you see the seeds of that Revolution right now don't you the desire for consumer goods is promoting the individual people are saying me me a lot it's all about what the individual wants it's about there rights it's about natural law what do people have a right to according to John Locke life liberty and property they can't take your life they can't take your freedom and they can't take your stuff see how that feeds straight into this consumer impulse and see how the consumer impulse builds that it will build it up to a revolutionary frenzy this is the root of the American Revolution the king knows the danger and he still went ahead with it this is ultimately going to be why America is the first major revolution in this period and it will not be the last it will trigger a whole bunch of them one right after another for the same basic reasons other people decide that they want their stuff too consumerism the consumer Revolution is powerful in America because America doesn't really have a well defined social race in England you have the aristocracy you have a rigid class system you can't move between those classes social Mobility is not really a possibility in Europe not just in England but in any of the European countries moving between social classes is very very hard to do it's not an easy thing where you're born is where you die that's your class but the colonies are different the English colonies give people a very real ability to change their social class they can go in as indentured servants one step away from slaves and if they survive and work hard and be able to generate success over the years they can become wealthy they can be one step below the aristocracy their landowners do you know how many people in in England actually own land how many the aristocracy are really the only big landowners there's a few people outside the aristocracy own land but not many which means if you are a landowner in the colonies you're one step away from being an aristocrat that is some really heavy stuff for these people social rank is no longer defined just by titles what defines it now how do you define social rank in a capitalist Society money more money you have the higher your social rank right and so there's a new demand for certain types of consumer goods they want stuff that is fashionable and portable they want stuff that is fashionable let's deal with that word First fashion we use it all the time but let's fully understand the implications of that work what is fashion what's that okay a trend of what is in right now yeah exactly what's the in thing it's something that is current what's the implication of that today it's in what is it tomorrow it goes out now let's say you buy a new shirt and it's the latest greatest fashion you're you're buying something fashionable within a year let's say that that fashion goes out and it's no longer fashionable to wear that now in that period of time is your shirt worn out is it Rowan no you can wear that shirt for quite a while still has plenty of life in it there's nothing wrong with it but because it goes out of fashion it's seen as tacky to keep wearing a former style that's out so if you are trying to be fashionable keep up with the most current Cutting Edge fashion if you're trying to do that then even though the shirt is perfectly good you're going to buy a new shirt to keep up with the fashion yeah yes exactly being fashionable is a way to wear your wealth it's not enough to Simply have money you have to show it in a way that everybody knows that you have money in other words conspicuous consumption that's the term for that where you're not just wealthy you're planting it you guys might call it something else how about bling you know what bling is right yes but it amounts to the same thing you can call it all sorts of different terms but essentially it was something that was very common back then to Define your social rank based on the wealth that you were outwardly wearing Distributing or displaying people had to know that you had it you were flaunting that you were wearing your wealth So Not only was it fashionable it was portable you wanted types of wealth that you could take with you you want the latest greatest jewelry you want the latest greatest Fashions you want all sorts of personal products that are small that you can carry with you you want to show off that well the rising standard of living led to people wanting that wealth well if your neighbor is suddenly showing that they have something something new something that they're very proud of and they're flaunting that what might that induce you to do try to get the same thing or even one of them right keeping up with the Joneses trying to maintain your rank by competing with them you might have a car that you bought 3 years ago still is perfect s that still has the new car smell you take meticulous care of it so it always looks good and then a couple doors down from you your neighbor shows up with a brand new car the latest greatest addition of the one you bought but it's this year's model not three years ago nothing wrong with your car and yet this is what fashion drives people to do it's the competition of social rank based on wealth and what you purchase with it has the demand for the wealthy segments of society to have the latest greatest Goods they also wanted stuff that went out of fashion quickly the wealthy we're pushing for that why if stuff goes out of fashion quickly you have to buy Replacements right well the wealthy can keep up with that they can keep up with the current Fashions they can afford them but for people who are trying to compete and Holding On by their fingernails trying to keep up with you and becomes harder and harder and harder to do that with stuff goes out of fashion and you have to replace it so fashion is something that they are pushing for because it you know they well I'm wearing the latest one you're wearing last season and it's a way for them to feel Superior about their social Rank and look down on other people for their lack of social right they're looking for products that will do that one thing that comes out of this name brand recognition this is one of the outgrowths of this mentality it's not enough to have the same quality product you have to have the product from the right maker you guys know about that right you want new shoes do you go down and get the $29.99 Payless that are on sale where do you go out and get the $200 Nikes the $200 Nikes they're the status that's the name brand but you're also paying for the name aren't you you're paying for it because it is Nike or fill in the blank whatever company you want to throw up there so paying for the brand name becomes part of it also it's not whether or not you can afford to buy the goods at a certain point they will distinguish social Rank by how well you master using those goods for example let's say you buy a brand new set of really really beautiful place and you have crystal glasses and sterling silver silverware and you throw a party and invite all the wealthy people from the area to come and then when the time comes to eat your salad you pick up you pick up the shrimp before oops that immediately reveals you as opposed you're somebody who is trying to reach above their status but you can try all you want but you're just not there and instead of reinforcing your position as being up here you're demonstrating that you belong a couple notches down why it wasn't enough to own the stuff you had to know how to use it properly if you're not using the right pork for the right thing if you're not using the right glass for the right beverage then you don't know how to master the use of those products so they start having schools in manners teaching people which work to use what to do in certain circumstances and if you go to a social Gathering and you are not up on the latest etiquette that shows that you are not quite up as high as others also you ever been to somebody's house and they have a piano and you say wow I didn't know you played I don't yeah why buy a piano if you don't play well back then having a piano would have been an incredible display well but if you can't play it what good is it you have to be able to afford the lessons to play it and more than that you have to be able to take the time to take the lessons and if you are busy earning money and you don't just have it you don't have the Leisure to actually learn how to play it properly so being able to master this is also a statement saying I have the time I have the money I have the ability to train properly and if you don't you're not as good so it's a way to promote their social Rank and look down on others for theirs new social roles come out of this type of consumerism the poor will constantly try to prove that they are higher than they are the people in the middle will reach up and try to be higher than they are everybody is reaching for another run some will be able to grab that and pull themselves up that is a possibility social climbing is possible but you got to be able to do it yeah absolutely yeah they want to protect they want to protect their family and maybe even move up socially by arranging a marriage between a daughter and a more prominent son from a more prominent family by marrying in they are able to boost their social rank through that marriage absolutely okay so let's take a look at a couple products and how they become uniquely American and at their heart revolutionary products let's start with the first one from these colonies that will become America tobacco tobacco is a really good product to look at tobacco is a popular product what do you need it no which means it's a luxury good it's something that you do for leisure you don't need it you only do it when you have down time so it's something you do for enjoyment or relaxation or whatever and it is also a product that is relatively inexpensive which means people from different classes can all partake in it equally they just they display their social rank in other ways for example if you are consuming tobacco can you think of a way that they might display their social rank nice pipes absolutely have you ever seen that movie American treasure a lot of people are going no some people are naughty one of the key things in that movie was this really elaborately carved height called amirsham pipe that became a key for a certain lock in the thing but the key here was that pipe that type of really luxurious elaborate beautiful pipe it's clearly the pipe of somebody incredibly wealthy it is a piece of art that you are smoking tobacco out of you holler up a fragment of the corn cob put us a twig on it that has a hole in the middle of it and you have a pipe not too big not too big of a deal you can make those yourself but everybody can partake in that tobacco can't they it's not really something that limits you based on how much money you have there are ways to display your social rank but tobacco with something that can be enjoyed by people across class lines and therein lies the product that is dangerous to England England is trying to maintain this status class divisions that are very rigid but the American colonies are fluid social Mobility is possible in England it's not class intermingling is happening when people partake in tobacco you can display by the types of products you have with it what your wealth is if people are chewing tobacco you might have really beautiful elaborate spoons for people to spit into if you are smoking you might have really elaborate pipes but ultimately you're both partaking in the same product another good product to look at is something that even to this day still is very uniquely in a very real way American culture when people get up in the morning and have their morning drink there are people who will have tea but by and large most people in this country have coffee that wasn't always the case what do they drink in England tea tea is the national drink there and coffee is the national drink here well all of that went back to the revolution coffee as opposed to tea tea and the way it was served was served according to your social rank there was a way you serve tea to low rank people in a way you serve tea to very high ranked people afternoon tea very pinky up and if you were in a different class you could not participate in that kind of consumption but in America anybody can drink coffee more than that in England when people gather socially to drink tea they do so in an establishment that is geared for them the wealthy go to a wealthy place the aristocrats go to a place that only the aristocracy go to commoners go to a place that only commoners go to you do not mix social class defines what sphere you are in you don't try to reach above that bad things can happen to you if you try whereas in America the coffee houses the wealthy go to them the middle class go to them the poor go to them and they can sit right next to each other in adjoining tables all in the same group so all of a sudden this class Crossing class intermingling becomes part of the consumption of this coffee but more than that the decision to drink coffee was a conscious one when England started taxing tea as a way to increase Revenue and colonists will protest that you guys have all heard about the Boston Tea Party well the fact is there were tea parties in places other than Boston they were protesting teeth and one way that you showed your support for America the colonial cause was to say you know what I'm not even going to drink tea I'm going to drink coffee instead and drinking coffee was a way of saying I support the colonial cause you're drinking tea oh I see you support the oppression of the crown coffee became a source of pride in the colonial identity but it also was rejecting this class-based system the classes were Reinventing themselves in America it really was different here in the colony than it was back in England a new social Norm had emerged here and they didn't even really fully realize it until sometimes they went back and visited England realizing wow things really are a lot different there than they are here I didn't expect that and suddenly they wake up to that whole idea we really are different coffee was a good example of that and not only did it display this class information Rebellion drinking coffee was a was a revolutionary Act you were revolting against England back in England drinking coffee and smoking tobacco we're seen as something that should only be done by the elite it should not be something that the poorer classes can partake in they try to restrict it unsuccessful the more they try the more the lower classes insist on doing it they thought it was eroding the moral fabric the moral fiber of society that it was encouraging laziness and idleness among the working class maybe it was maybe it was but things had definitely changed for the colonies versus England another thing that happens in the midst of all this is that the status of women is going to go up consumerism gives women more power more influence how does that work women become the Agents of purchasing the men are still deciding when to buy something they are the ones who control the money the woman wants a new table and the husband says no it's not time for that I don't have the money for it we're going to wait and eventually he will say okay times come we can go get that table we can go get that so go out and pick the table that you want whatever you want here's the money this is how much you can spend you go get the table so the man still deciding when to spend the money he's choosing to do it but the woman ends up being the one who actually spends it now how does that improve her status how does that give her more power in society okay they get to choose what they want and that's certainly part of it okay think of a woman going into a store and she wants to go talk to the furniture maker who's going to make her table for and she says okay I'm going to go try this one here she goes into the store the furniture makers talking to a man who's already in there and while she's waiting another man comes in and so now there's two people waiting well the shop shop owner finishes with the man and instead of dealing with the woman he starts talking to the man instead okay and how does she respond to that while I see how much my business really matters I'm going to go to that furniture maker down the street and see what they have to say and so she'll leave the shop and go to the other furniture store and this one rather than shunning her since hello welcome what are you in the market for and she tells him oh that's a nice idea hey have you thought about maybe doing this style and this stuff I like this guy I'm going to buy from him and suddenly because she is being treated better by somebody else she is voting with her pocketbook the money that she is spending becomes a way of exerting power she has a limited amount of influence but that influences real it's tangible she can choose where she spends that money and that makes a difference people start realizing hey if they want a woman's business and the women often times choose where to spend the money they need to treat those women with more respect and so the status of women the power of women is gradually going up so basically there's two major impacts that come out of the consumer Revolution that happens here in the colonies class intermingling becomes possible where back in Europe that wasn't common the class intermingling is going to give Colonial character a very distinct difference from what you see back in Europe and that is excuse me going to lay the foundations for revolution because they're going to develop more of an individual identity it's going to focus on what the individual wants eating those individualist desires the second big one is the creation of a consumer culture that is based on what you want rather than what you need people will change their buying patterns because of this you are going to see advertising evolved because of this as well when people bought what they what they needed versus what they want it they were more interested in what a product could do so that they could see if it fit their needs well I need something that does this oh well this one does this this this and this so that's what you look for but when they're selling products to People based on what they want they're going to have to figure out that advertising those products is a little bit different you don't just give them a recitation of all of the different features of that product you have to tell why they want you have to feed that ego you have to stroke it you have to kind of play into that mentality you know you want this because it does this for you you know you want that because it makes you more powerful more attractive more whatever you're feeding a concept and this is going to cause advertising to change okay that is a good getting your feet wet introduction to Consumers okay we're going to build on this as we go and show how America becomes very distinctive okay have a good week I will see you next Wednesday don't come on Monday I won't be here take your exam instead</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%2012/1460%20Apr%2012/","title":"1460 Apr 12","text":"<ul> <li>Industrial revolution<ul>

I'm sick I need medicine and so they had to stock medicine in their house and these guys would sell people out in the boonies all the medicine that they could want medicine for this medicine for that but the medicines did not always have a legitimate effect sometimes they were completely worthless they were benign others could actually have a legitimate effect and we're a little bit more reliable because the thing actually did do something and yet others were even dangerous okay so there's a wide range of patent medicines that you could find the most common one in fact it becomes synonymous with pet medicine and the darker sides the fact that it's oftentimes a con in order to get you to buy something worthless is snake oil have you ever heard of somebody being referred to as a snake oil salesman well that phrase basically comes from somebody trying to sell you a product that doesn't work there are Karma however let's talk about the stage that this is being sent in first of all before 1906 there was no medical or drug regulation in the United States in other words you can sell what you want stick a label on it call it whatever you want and if somebody drank it and got sick or died everywhere that's on them you're not at all that's how they kind of looked at things and as a result of this the medical field had sort of a untrustworthy reputation now today do you have a problem going to the hospital when you get sick no reason being after 1906 everything starts getting regulated first they start with Food and Drugs and then they will start in on the medical industry saying we need to be able to trust our doctors so they have medical schools established they have people who have to go through a specific line of training they agree with the curriculum should be at these medical schools and they hold the people accountable to them they have doctors exams they have licensing that they have to go through so you know whether you're going to a legitimate doctor or a quest somebody who's got no training at all they say they're a doctor but they're not so people in this period trust these doctors and Drug salesman or not bottom line most of the time they don't trust doctors unless that doctor is somebody they've known their whole life like a country dot they may have been the doctor who delivered them into this world and every time they get sick that doctor is the one who comes over and Deals one hey fine you can trust them you know them but in a random City a random doctor you don't know if you're getting legitimate health care or if it's just somebody who's stuck doctor on the wall and they're winging that's kind of a little dangerous patent medicines emerged in the same period of time when Medical the medical industry was a little bit Shady a little bit more unreliable so let's take a look at patent medicines one common ingredient in a lot of patent medicines that are affected with something called latinum does anybody heard of London what is an opium alkalate now what is opium you guys know any opiates there's a couple heroin morphine Vicodin codeine yeah all of those are opiates and there's plenty more okay Lawton is in that same family it is a type of opiate that is fairly Weak by comparison to something like Morphine Morphine is pretty strong so it's more in the line of maybe codeine or maybe around the Vicodin level somewhere in that that range as far as its strength but London is typically liquid so it's good to use in a lot of syrups that people would drink when they're sick so what was it used for a so perfect that is a sleeping agent if you are having insomnia problems and you need to get to sleep they will give you a sleeping thing with loud in a minute and say this will knock you out and that one actually works if you get some kind of a sleeping medication that has a lot in a minute yeah it works just be careful not to have it all the time otherwise what's the downside of opiates you can get addicted exactly so sleep inducers often times they are in cold medications if you want some kind of a cough syrup or something they will often put lot in that to help somebody not only cut down on the aches and pains that come with a cold you know how you get all achy and you feel like crap well this will kind of settled some of those aches and pains and help you get some sleep when you're all stuffed up and it's hard to fall asleep like that we've all been there Magnum actually helps with that meningitis which is very uncomfortable so it's used as a pain reliever menstrual cramps they didn't have Midol back then so this is a way to treat female menstrual cramps and another big one there's another side effect to opiates anybody who's ever used them you get constipated so it's a good remedy if you have diarrhea help sperm things up a bit but the downside is it is addictive as a matter of fact one of the first ladies of the United States wife of a president was an addict to learn them Mary Todd Lincoln Abraham Lincoln's wife is also used in a less medical way for a working class drug instead of alcohol because alcohol could be expensive for people who were looking for a regular pick me up or let down at the end of the day or whatever and Lawton was cheaper it was easier to afford if you were working class is London still used in the medical community today rarely but yes for severe diarrhea problems they might prescribe blood in them as an anti-diarial but the big thing that they tend to use it for is for babies who are born to women who are addicted to some drug or another maybe a woman's addicted to heroin or crack cocaine this was big in the 90s a lot of crack babies were being born and they would use the ladenum to help the baby ease through the withdrawals of The Other Drug so essentially they used one drug to give them a way to get off the other one and then before they get addicted to the law in them they face it all out so it takes place over usually about a week period but it's a way to gradually reduce that addictive level for babies so you can tell that it's barely it's safe to a point it's fairly mild it is able to be used judiciously but you have to be careful with it where it becomes dangerous is when it's included in something called infants soothing syrup if you have a infant who is acting up and colicky and just not want to sleep you give him some of the infant soothing suit yeah good moms do not feed their kids opium just saying okay so snake one where did that come from well first off in the gold rush and all those people from China who are coming over often brought their home remedies with them and one of those home remedies was the oil of a specific type of snake in China that when you use it and rubbed it into your joints it helped remove help reduce inflammation and soreness so if you had a problem with arthritis this was actually a really great treatment it worked and when the miners see these Chinese rubbing this stuff in they go what is that stuff that you're using they go it's snake oil they don't know the name for the snake they just know it's a snake so they go snake oil snake oil does that actually work and they say here try it and the miners rub it in oh yeah that feels great hey that's that's really good get some even more profit and so they start rendering down the snake oil only to find that their snake oil doesn't work yeah it's the Chinese water snake it's a specific type of snake that has specific types of characteristics very high acidity value to it and when it goes in the acid attacks the inflammation and causes it to go down but it's not typical for most snakes it's just that one type of thing the snake oil is actually legitimate but any other kind of snake it's not in fact some people will start making snake oil that has no snake oil in it they'll use things like beef fat camper turpentine things like that to mimic it and add some extra stuff in it but some of it will have absolutely no snake oil in it at all okay here's an interesting one Clark Stanley snake oil but the strange thing is it actually did work to help reduce inflammation first of all it had mineral oil not snake oil 1% beef fat so there was a little beef that put in there camper turpentine these were common for snake oil ingredients but here's the winner red pepper red pepper has capsicum and capsicum is an anti-inflammatory that's why a lot of people say well if you have arthritis having a lot of Mexican food that's really really super spicy can actually help reduce your aches if you ever heard that probably not well skip it just get some muscle relaxers and call it good okay so let's take a look at some of these snake oils and see what's the hooksters that would travel from town to town would often be in carts pulled by horses that are like this notice it's very graphic really jumps out at you well this thing is not just a wagon it's also a mobile billboard everywhere they're going they're advertising their product people know when they're coming to town oh look you there I wonder what they've got so it catches your attention it catches your eye but also this isn't just a wagon it's so much more first of all inside there's plenty of storage for the extra product but there's also a bed where the salesman can sleep at night so it's kind of like having a mobile hotel room wherever they go place to sleep so all their personal stuff is in there they're products are up here but this big piece here on the side that's a single piece of wood then swings up and is put on poles and then it serves as an overhang here for what is underneath so as you swing the thing up underneath our rows and rows and rows of their product so this is a built-in storefront all they have to do is just pop it up and they're ready to go selling they give their Spiel people by the stuff they pack it all up and they're gone easy quick release they can be out of town in 5 to 10 minutes now here's a more reputable patent medicine in that they're not claiming any specific extra medical things but that it's a natural herb remedy based on normal foods and herbs and spices and stuff that that you can get but it's done in such a way that increases the metabolism the pick me up the girls need and it's targeting girls so let's see what this says here she looks despondent worn out and depressed young girls butting into Womanhood often get quiet and wistful hormone last attitude overtakes them they should be watched what if they figured out how to use what are they selling what are they selling your girl needs what are they really selling they're making you afraid of something or something fear is one of the most powerful sales motives out there you make somebody afraid of something and then you're selling a solution you want to sell a product that's a good way to do it here oh you should be very afraid of your daughter when she starts acting like that we've all been through puberty people we know what happens we know what happens to our kids when they start going through it kids get moody during this period of time but here they want to make me feel afraid of it and then sell them a remedy Lydia Pickens she looks very respectable doesn't she somehow I think it's probably not a company run by an older woman just saying I love this one I'm going to go through this and then I'm going to tell you that this one actually has an effective active ingredient Baldwin's pet medicine the medicine of nature a life invigorating remedy for nervousness debility that's like where you feel a little weak consumption tuberculosis insomnia and lonus of spirits now I'm going to tell you the active ingredient and then we'll go through this list again active ingredient cocaine okay a life invigorating remedy oh yeah you'll feel great for nervousness do you really want to give somebody who's got nervousness problems Coke only if you want to go out of their skull it'll be a basket case after that so no one here debility you feel weak will Coke make you feel stronger oh yeah you'll feel like King Kong for a while consumption interestingly enough this one actually works because when you take cocaine it causes a lot of stuff in your body to tighten up the blood vessels shrink a little bit and the problem with tuberculosis is your lungs fill up with fluid and the the cocaine actually tightens that up so your lungs aren't filling up with fluid white so fast speaking of sleep do you really want to give cocaine to somebody with insomnia you guys know that if you have cocaine you're going to be up for the next two days right okay yeah this one is not a case that you want to use for insomnia Lotus of spirits oh yeah you want to pick me up OK Google here's a great one then Mariani popular French tonic wine it's a nice healthy life invigorating wine that has good health benefits actually medically speaking red wine does have certain health benefits taken in moderation cardiac benefits and whatnot but here the key is what do they do celebrity endorsement they got the pope to endorse it probably with a very nice large donation to the Catholic Church his Holiness Awards gold medal in recognition of benefits received from Ben Mariani Mariani wine tonic supposedly he was sick had some of this and it made him feel better but now we enter the world of celebrity endorsement that's what this is the pope is endorsing it this might as well be Nike hiring Michael Michael Jordan to be the face of their new brand Air Jordans wow that there's a good movie about that yeah I haven't seen it yet myself but I want to it's got like a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes which is just unheard of them anyway here's one of the more Dangerous Ones Capital white lead company now this company made things of various types including lead and Color Works you guys have heard of lead-based paint right white LED treatment for arthritis rubbing this stuff into your joints now how many of you have seen the Alice in Wonderland Alice in Wonderland have you seen that yeah okay you know the Mad Hatter you know why he's insane it's from licking the needles that he uses to show up the hats and it has lead and mercury in it and it unbalances his mind okay that's why he's the Mad Hatter in other words getting lead into your system is not a good thing so avoid it oh this is my all-time favorite cigarettes or powder probably cures asthma do you want to give an asthmatic cigarettes now you can tell that this is made by a consummate con artist what else does it address hey fever what it takes care of your allergies too kind of a brain fog thing and then I love this one oppression not depression which is like I feel so bad I want to get up no oppression from third world dictators Suffocation somebody's holding a pillow over your face boy this will fix that you can tell that this was not made by somebody who is educated they were just throwing things in there hey they'll buy it anyway no problem we can sell whatever we want they're just ordinary cigarettes but they sell them as health benefits yeah so you had to really be careful when you deal with the world of patent medicines okay so let's come back to the railroads railroads change everything when the Transcontinental line links up everything about business in America changes now up to this point the big business does anybody know where big business was really centered take a stab if you were to think about a big business City up to the Civil War what was the big city it was known for Commerce New York maybe Boston maybe Philadelphia yeah they're on one side of the country well for you one side of the country what about the other side if you're doing business out of New York can you effectively do business in California with that company not really ideal for that and that's when the middle of the country becomes far more important with the rise of the Transcontinental Railroad comes the rise of a new major city that becomes the focal point of business in this Second Industrial Revolution period Chicago Chicago will become the center of the American railroad World you've heard the phrase all roads lead to Rome because the Roman Empire they were these big roadbuilders and all of them would eventually find their way to Rome well all roads lead to Rome all railroads lead to Chicago same basic principle Chicago was designed to be the center Hub and as a result they have the fastest trains running out of Chicago if you have an older slower train you don't put it on a Chicago route you put it out in the boonies Chicago wants speed they want efficiency the best trains the most trains the fastest trains are running out of Chicago so if you want something delivered fast you have a Chicago room if you want something delivered in massive quantities you have in Chicago room if you have a perishable item something that's going to spoil if too much time goes by Chicago is your choice Chicago becomes the place where speed is key if you have speed issues Chicago is the best place also another thing about Chicago because there's so much traffic out of there and all the roots are super fast now how many of you have seen an old western where they're on a cow Drive you see those cowboys taking the cattle over long distances did you ever ask why are they moving why are they moving them why move them hundreds of miles like that in cattle drive well what are they doing they're taking their cattle along some kind of a roof that's pre-established that will lead right to a rail hub Abilene Kansas Dodge City or Abilene Texas Dodge City Kansas these are rail hubs where people can take their cattle and load them on trains so that they could be transported to Chicago Chicago is where the slaughterhouse is worth why me spoils and they can get it out of Chicago to the marketplace anywhere in the country before that happens the only place in the country where that's really possible okay so Chicago becomes the center of this new second industrialization world of the United States but then a couple of other people really key into these changes in what they mean one of the first guys who really effectively capitalizes on it is a man named Montgomery Ward Montgomery Ward has anybody heard of Montgomery Ward used to be the name of a major retail store it went bankrupt in the '80s but it was his business that he started up way back when and it became like a department store yeah anyway it's a little before your time but still I thought maybe somebody would have heard of it at some point Montgomery Ward was a Salesman who frequently traveled out into the boonies and realize that when he got into rural communities a lot of them were very very suspicious of the products that are being sold by companies in the cities namely because every time they buy a product from some big company in the city they get it and either it doesn't work straight out it comes in completely worthless or it will break very quickly and become worthless and when they try to get their money back for it because it was junk you're told sorry all sales are final and so they feel like they're getting screwed by people in the cities that they're victimized because of that and what they really want is just access to the same kind of goods that people in the city have just because they're in the countryside doesn't mean that they don't want products too yeah they might be Farmers but they want some of those conveniences they just don't like being cheated in the processary I am going to start researching all these different types of goods that people in the countryside want and I'm going to test them all out one by one and I'm going to make sure that I only put the good tested products in my catalog then he starts putting out a mail order catalog but what makes it unique is he guarantees that if you are not satisfied send it back and he will refund your money what's more that satisfaction guaranteed money money back that they can get from it it's something that he actually follows through with so if something does break right away or it's not working right they'll send it back to him and he will give them their money back so he gets a reputation for being honest and respectable doing legitimate business and of course a lot of the products work as advertised so his products have good success rate and if they break he backs it what's more is if it starts breaking regularly and he gets a whole bunch back he goes back to the manufacturer and he says I have a lot of demand for these but I'm not going to keep them in my catalog unless you fix it and at that point they have to go he's telling us how to do our business but he is ordering a lot maybe we ought to see what we can do to fix that whereas if it was anybody else I'd say hi you know buyer beware and they wouldn't even respond to it but with enough volume of purchasing somebody can go in and stay hey you have to start making your products better quality otherwise I won't carry it and so he actually gets those big businesses to respond in a positive way love his catalog it started out as only 13 pages long in 1872 10 years later the catalog is 240 pages and he has tested out every product in there it will continue to grow over time and his dominance in the mail order business will last all the way into the 1890s before it is effectively challenged the man who challenges Montgomery Ward and ultimately surpasses it if someone named Richard Warren Sears Richard Warren Sears was a railroad agent he worked for the railroad and he frequently went up and down the railroad lines to different towns and so he was always traveling on business and one thing that he liked to do since his operation was out of Chicago The Hub he would go looking around town for all sorts of really great stuff that people down the line might be interested in and see if he could get it from a bargain one day he got into this jewelry shop and this Jeweler had six absolutely gorgeous pocket watches that he had made they were beautiful and he was selling them for a steal and Sears said how come these are so low I mean I've seen stuff like this a whole lot more expensive than he says yeah but they're just not selling people aren't buying them right now I don't know what to do and so Richard Warren Sears takes a look at that and he says you know what I'll take all six ers then take these on down the line and sells them one at a time in various locations for more than double what he paid for I can do my job as a railroad agent and make some extra money on the side I'm doing really great he gets back to Chicago talks of that jewelry he says I'll make a deal if you're willing to sell them to me for that same price you just sold them to me I will pay for 20 up front Jeweler says done he comes back a couple weeks later the watches are all made he takes those sells them on down the line for more than double for all of them it only takes one trip and he's sold all 20 of them at that point Richard Warren Sears says okay railroads are the key to this business but rather than selling things one at a time it'd be a whole lot better people came to me now of course he knows about Montgomery Ward he says you know that catalog is really successful because of that satisfaction guaranteed money or your money back that he puts on there money back guarantee that's what people want to see now he does not want to go through the process of Montgomery Ward did testing every single product so he'll put stuff in his magazine sight unseen but if they start coming back as junk and he has to keep refunding money he will go to them saying fix this or I'm never doing business with you again and even more than Montgomery Ward Sears is pushing so much they can't afford to ignore Sears did something very significant as well a lot of times people at this period of time who were Jewish were very discriminated against but he found a man named Alva Roebuck who was there's no other word for a genius he was a logistical genius he knew how to organize everything the whole process of ordering to filling to delivery he had it all down he was brilliant and so Richard Lawrence Sears goes into business with this guy named alvaroba started the Sears robot company Sears did the sales he did the marketing Roebuck took care of the logistics people order we fill it we send it and railroads were the key for shipping their stuff out they could get anything to any place in the country and under two weeks that's incredible for that period of time anywhere even out in the boonies they could get to you in less than 2 weeks people wanted City Goods so they they stood up to that but they also held the businesses accountable when the businesses are cutting corners and their products are bad Sears comes in and says you fix this right stop doing business with me they fix it they wouldn't listen to the little guy but they will listen to him both of them will send you their mail order businesses in Chicago they have the fastest most economic roots in the country so both of them you Chicago is that hub to give you an idea of how fast Sears group it took 11 years before Montgomery Ward had a 240 page cattle it started at 13th within a year Sears catalog was at 322 pages the following year it was $532 pages yikes he is just play the 1970s the Sears catalog is this thick they won't even send it to you you actually had to go to a Sears store to look through it because they don't carry all the products in the store if you don't see it in the store they'll order it for you out of the catalog so you can go down to the catalog department and order out of their massive catalog of course they don't do that anymore you want to order something from them you do it online a lot easier but it kind of gives you an idea of how significant their mail order business really was they will even start carrying model T's at one point yeah you can buy a car through his catalog he will sell you a Model T and transport it to you yeah kind of interesting now when the catalogs initially come into the countryside the people who run the local country stores are very unfriendly about that they see these as a threat but then their opinion changes over time they can't stock everything and when people come in looking for something they say we just don't carry it don't get enough demand for it now they can say I don't care but hey I've got this catalog let's look through it and see what we can find and we'll get it ordered for you and people think hey this store guys really great he's got that catalog I know anytime I need something that he doesn't have he can order it for me that pulls people into his store hey do you have this and he can say yes and they'll buy it or hey you have this and so it actually helps their business it doesn't hurt it that was something that the store owners in the remote areas start coming to realize what is the significance of Montgomery Ward and Sears Roebuck first of all it brought the same level of consumerism that people in the cities enjoy out to people in the countryside a lot of people in rural communities felt like that the city dwellers urbanites are always looking down their nose with them are they right yeah they see him as picks out in the sticks hey hey see been looking at the back end of that sheep too long yeah they really go after him and so the people in the city do tend to have an attitude well part of that is earn there is more Creature Comforts in the cities than in the countryside there's more products there's a lot of things that cities have that Countryside doesn't consumerism is now available in the countryside and that means at least as a consuming country and remember America is a place that was established as a consumer Haven people want their stuff ever since the colonial period it's been that way well this makes it possible for them to have access to more and better stuff and to do so in a very reasonable way in ways that it was still very much divided after the Civil War also they learn how to sell if you don't sell a product if you're trying to sell a product you don't sell the product you sell a concept you sell what that product will do for you you don't sell the product itself you can say well it does this this this and this by it today and there's still people who try that and it kind of works if that's what you're looking for but if you're trying to persuade someone to buy you have to use persuasion the right way you sell them a concept comfort quality of life convenience help fear and a solution for them vanity looking your very best sex appeal you want to be attracted to the opposite sex or whoever you're being attracted to hey fun this is a big thing with cars they still do this there was a car commercial out a few years back it was a Cadillac dad I don't know if any of you remember it where a woman sits inside this car and the announcer says when you turn on your car does it return Yes what features do they have in that car that I haven't heard about anyway sex is a big seller if you can equate sex appeal with a product sells very well so these are just a number of the concepts that can be sold but there's a lot more think about all the different things that people feel inadequate about or they really wish they had a better way of doing things for or you know something needs to be addressed they have character flaws that make them self-conscious about certain things product to address that so you heighten their self-consciousness and then you sell in the solution that's Modern Advertising right there people sure yep exactly yeah good case she was saying didn't they sell milk this way when they started cutting the milk down to like 2% and then they started selling skim milk as a way for women to watch their figures hey remove the fat it's a whole lot healthier for you you're not drinking all that fat on your hips time there's a big leap forward in technology as well and one of the people most responsible for that big Leap Forward was a man named Thomas Alva Edison now when you think of Thomas Edison what comes to mind usually anybody know what he's really famous for the light bulb yes he's famous for making he didn't invent the light bulb he invented the first practically manufacturable rifle which is really even more important because we now sit in a sea of Edison in so many things in this room Edison is responsible for them the motion picture camera and the motion picture projector modern movies this screen ultimately you go far enough back he inspires this music the entire music industry he started it what music onto a hard medium so that you can listen to it again and again now eventually they will go from cylinders to records and you can still get records today although most people are under either CDs or MP3s or whatever else but he set up modern media everything that we have how many have you watch the movie this week how many of you have listened to music at one point this week he's responsible for that so he's responsible for so many things but he's also responsible for why we have electricity coming out of our walls plug all over the place and his rival was a man named Nikola Tesla Nikola Tesla was in it for the science Edison was in it for the money Edison was a greedy bastard he wanted to get rich he wanted to be a Robert Barron and in fact he became one let me give you an example of that how many of you have an electric bill okay who do you pay your bill to what's the company's name Southern California Edison yeah he's been dead a century and you're still paying yikes talk about rich kind of blows your mind to think about that doesn't yeah they're really big rubber bands you're still paying money to anybody ever buy their gas from Chevron you're still paying Rockefeller Chevron so Robert barons in a lot of ways they're still alive and well today okay so Thomas Edison was wanting to build up the power grid he controlled power distribution for the City of New York which was a great place to start that's where the real rich and the real famous all live but in order to sell electricity you needed stuff that ran on electricity so he had to come up with new inventions he had to show that hey here's a product that runs on electricity that you can't benefit from without it and the light bulb was a key everybody loves light bulbs imagine what your life is like today if somebody shuts your power off after a day it becomes really inconvenient after 3 days your food is spoiled in the refrigerator and your emptying out your freezer because it all melted everything's starting to get nasty after a week of being out of power things are really getting ugly aren't they imagine what it's like being in the middle of that all of a sudden shut off the power of your back in the 1800s that's where you're at you want to cook and fire up the grill in the backyard you're cooking over fire you want water you have to bring the water from outside well actually it's not electric so I suppose maybe the water pump still work but basically think about big natural disasters and what people go through that is basically reverting you all the way back to the 1800s Edison is largely responsible for bringing us into what we have today the modern convenience is we get used to and he created over 2,000 inventions that he has patents for now did he invent those himself he had armies of people inventing stuff but where he makes his real contribution is this he invented a method of assembly line invention using the industrial factory system to create new products this is where his contribution is why you ever hear of a company called Intel they use the same exact process that Edison pioneer to modify and make their chips better whole teams of people in an assembly line processor trying different things what about bees how often do they come out with the new phone every 6 months they're about certainly once a year at least okay that's because Samsung Apple LG Google Microsoft and whoever else is putting out phones all are trying to do the next best thing they want to improve their phone and so they've got armies of people working on every little feature hey we found a way to make the computer chip faster oh great hey we found a way to make the screen sharper hey we found a way to get better definition out of the camera and they incorporate those in the next edition of their phone modern research and development that's what he created this is the way our technology companies operate today they get more and more efficient and far better at it over time he's the one who showed everybody how to do it now he had an ongoing dispute with a man named George Westinghouse and Westinghouse is the guy who financially back Tesla now this led to a battle over the format Edison wanted to put out DC power whereas Tesla was advocating for alternating current health which one do we have in our walls you know what kind of power is coming out of that plug AC so Tesla won this one well part of the reason is because people don't really like Edison they admire him and all of his accomplishments but the truth is Edison was a jerk he was not a nice person and he rubbed a lot of people the wrong way whereas Tesla wasn't really offensive but Edison still went after him with a vengeance now one thing I want to show you here is what Edison will do to try to show the dangers of AC power he is going after Westinghouse he's going after Tesla saying AC power should not be used because it's dangerous DC power doesn't have nearly the amount of danger that AC power does it's too easy to get electrocuted and so to that end he uses a big popular invention that he came up with the motion picture camera the motion picture projector to make a movie showing exactly why they should go with DC power and not AC power he bought an elephant called topsy from the Coney Island Zoo shown here now was older she was an old elephant and Edison says I'm going to hook up a whole bunch of electrodes to toss Topsy and run AC power through them and I'm going to show you exactly how dangerous this is now if this happened today pedo would be all over him here it is this is the movie he made notice he's running electricity through it now there goes topsy there's Edison okay now this Movie lasted a little longer than that it was about 30 seconds or so long so you get to see the whole jolt and then the smoke starts to rise and rise and rise and then boom you see the the part where the elephant died all right despite that very graphic demonstration people still agree to go with ACS and the reason is because AC is a lot more flexible and it's easy to use it's easy to distribute over longer distances Within the local sphere in order to do it with DC power into homes you have to do what are called loops which is a little bit more cost of cost expending but very efficient use of DC power can make this a good choice so Edison wasn't entirely wrong as a matter of fact if you want to go to England and use your stuff on it you can you need what's called a Transformer power transformer you probably heard a power Transformers right oh the Transformer probably blue well what is the Transformer do it changes AC to DC or DC to AC that's the job of it that's what it's designed to do and Edison actually got a patent off of this turns out the state of New York was so impressed with his demonstration that they decided to use it in capital punishment this was the invention of the electric chair when he and when he electrocuted Topsy and put her to death using electricity they said hey that looks like a pretty efficient way to kill people too so New York starts using the electric chair and others will adopt it as well okay another invention that he is credited with inventing was something called the fluoroscope you would better know it today as an x-ray machine using x-rays one thing around the turn of the 20th century that 1880 to 1920 period saw a big rise in experimentation with radioactivity this is the same time that Madame Curie Mary Curie is doing all the scientific experiments to use radium to treat cancer she makes a lot of leaps forward in that but she ultimately gets cancer from the radiation and dies but she won two Nobel prizes along the way how many people can say that one too much much less one yeah pretty significant but he saw that radioactivity as a possible application that he could use so he gets hold of X-ray material and uses it and says okay I'm going to take a picture of the human body would it work well he gets a subject one of his employees lays down on the table takes the picture of him the guy dies two days later from radiation exposure Edison would not go near that thing again he says that thing is just too dangerous I'm not touching it again somebody else will come along later and say no no Edison's machine actually works all you got to do is turn it down he had it set 200 times higher than it needed to be that's why the guy died he died of radiation overdose but if you turn it way down all of a sudden it becomes a whole lot safer now how many of you have not had an x-ray in your life even teeth you don't have your teeth x-rayed teeth is one people forget about oh yeah that's right everybody's had them we've all had one Edison invented the technology for that too so he had a big big impact in how a lot of those things were established there was another big technology that Rose in the consumer culture of America as well that changed it forever something that affects all of us cars automobiles now before they were Horseless carriages which basically had an on-off switch it was either moving or it wasn't there was no real speed control also they didn't have brakes you were accelerating or you were just coasting and you would roll to a stop does that sound like a good way to drive no brakes on your car yeah not very safe and Ford starts experimenting with different features of Horseless carriages to make them more usable more controllable eventually he comes out with a product that he says okay this one's ready to mark and so in 1906 he puts out his very first model car the model n and he sells it for $600 his car company is capable of putting out 100 cars per day at this point and he is getting so many orders in he can't keep up it wasn't long before the glaring limitations of the model and become apparent and Henry Ford is absolutely committed to improving on that design and it was then that he will release will be released in what during 1908 and it would be coming out in 1909 so the model and had only been on the market for about 2 years now the things with the model n first there was no roof also it only set two people and for families that doesn't do anybody any good and so he promises this new car will have some kind of head Shield they will have that capability it would seat enough people to where you can put a family in there reasonably so long as it wasn't too big and so in 1809 he starts getting ready for the release and he opens up orders and before he's ever even made one car he already has 10,000 orders lined up for 825 each now keep in mind the time back then that was a lot of money still Within Reach of people in the middle class but below that not so much Ford was looking for ways to reduce the cost of this car he wants to make it affordable for people he doesn't want to cut the people in the middle and and down below out of being able to use them he wants this to be accessible so the biggest advance that he is known for is not the assembly line everybody says well what did he come up with the assembly line other companies were using assembly lines already what he came up with was something called the mobile assembly line and this is what he was known for the mobile assembly line doesn't just manufacture the products and then assemble them all at the end that's the way most factories do it he assembled the products but then assembled the big product along the way as those parts were put on it so the part itself moved along a conveyor to each stop where people would do something to it it would move to the next spot where they would do something to it move to the next spot Etc they had short repeatable tasks and then it went on to somebody else who had a short repeatable task and that was far more effective and putting this thing together consistently with quality and with speed he's able to greatly cut down on the speed it takes also he finds other ways to innovate he says okay if somebody is standing here if you bring a party in on the floor they have to bend down to pick it up before they can put it on the car so that's inefficient it costs 5 to 10 seconds every time somebody picks up a part after you repeat that 100 times that's a lot of time time he's paying for that isn't being spent wisely so instead he says let's deliver on waste value oh waste level excuse me so all you have to do is just bend it here pick up the part put it on and he says don't have people moving anymore than this or this 30\u00b0 either way 30\u00b0 up and down this is your operating Zone if you can do that now there's some where you have caps that you just can't do that with but you still limit the range of motion the more you can limit the range of motion the cheaper it is to produce labor expenses are the biggest manufacturing costs but it's not the only thing he's targeting he also says you can have a Model T any color you want so long as that color is black one color one type of paint and why black is the cheapest paint to produce and how many of you've done those experiments in high school science class where you compare the heat absorption between black and other colors and you realize that black absorbs heat a lot faster than everything else that makes the process faster speed is profit the faster you get these things out the less money it costs you Along Came people who said you know he's saving money in a lot of different ways but does that really mean that this is a great car it's reliable they're still model teas that run today they use them in parades mainly or car shows but they're still running they're still operational it was a fantastic car he sold over 9 million by 1920 so basically in a decade that's huge for the amount of people that were around the world at that point that's a lot of people down to 490 he's finding ways to make it cheaper one way he doesn't put an electric starter on it to start the engine you get out front and you crank it until it catches but do you really want to be out in the freezing cold rain up to your ankles and mud turning that thing over hoping your car start that sound like fun to you also there's no doors it's an open-air cabin okay so if it's 10\u00b0 outside you're getting a windshield that's cool if it's 20 below you're not using the thing you're staying inside and people are saying man close cabins would be great he says well it costs money to buy doors cost money to buy Windows the seats are hard wooden benches no upholstery and if you don't have upholstery he says no big deal if people want to sit on cushions they can provide their own but I'm keeping the cost of the car down to where people can afford to buy it but they bought cars differently than we did at least in most cases how many people go into a car dealership and put cash down for the entire car are there some who do what is that normal today most people Finance their cars and that's where General Motors comes in General Motors goes after Ford in big way they realize that the big problem with Ford is that people have to Shell out all of that money all at once up front to buy their car and so they team up with their big chemical and paint supply and together they come up with a joint venture to create the General Motors Acceptance Corporation they're Finance line they finance their own vehicles and because they can charge interest they make money on that financing trade-ins become popular as well when people say well I just bought a Ford 3 years ago and I love your car but I can't afford to just up and buy another one they say you don't have to pay the whole price will take your car in as a trade in and give you credit toward your new car make it part of your down payment you can Finance the rest okay that's starting to make sense so what did GM create they created the new used car market that will emerge where all of a sudden the cars that are coming in as trade-ins sell down here but then they finance those and now they can reach the working class so they're making the cars more accessible to everyone and the quality of cars and all the stuff that they get the whistles and bells upholstery hydraulic brakes instead of mechanical brakes Ford says mechanical brakes won't fail takes a lot of leg strength to hold those you still got 3 minutes okay and a lot of people who don't have that leg strength they're saying man I'd like those I'd like an easier breaking system hydraulic brakes what do we use today do you have to really stomp on your brakes to get your car to stop Hydraulics you have hydraulic brakes today so that is now the norm General Motors makes closed cabin cars in 1919 only 10% of cars manufactured worldwide had closed cabin by 1927 83% were closed cabin cars only 17% were remaining Ford will see his sales dwindled down to where he's only selling his cars for $310 and people stop buying them by 1926 he has to shut down his plant re-engineer a new car that's when the bottle a comes out it's closed cabin it has an electric starter it has Windows that go up and down it has doors everything enclosed has nice comfortable seats like GM put out GM also figured out that people will buy cars at different level the car isn't just a car it says something about the driver and so they use the status symbols why buy a car here for everybody when the wealthy can afford a car here that's super nice and says look at me I'm important one here and so they come up with different branding and different levels Chevrolet Oldsmobile then up here you looking Cadillac eventually they'll see a gap between Oldsmobile and Chevrolet where they missed a bit and they put a new brand in there and they're able to use a lot of interchangeable parts from different models that are common but they get the nicer cars all the way up so that becomes an important status symbol but the marketing is where they really end up going after things remember how we talked about in the consumer Revolution how they had changes in fashion that made people buy new stuff constantly well this is what GM will Pioneer every year they're model is a little different which encourages people to trade in their old one and buy a new one and of course they make money on every single term so this becomes a status symbol but how they sell is also revolutionary they focus on something modern in this time Psychology was the big name and psychology is what they will capitalize subtle but I catching persuasion little ways to equate a car with other things freedom Independence sex appeal power importance social status all of these different things are things that they will sell do car companies still do this absolutely when you turn on your card is it return the favor sexy yeah okay that's a good place to break so I will see you all Wednesday have a good one</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%2013/1460%20Apr%2019/","title":"1460 Apr 19","text":"<p>Click here to download .webm audio recording! :) Click here to download .webm audio

Transcript","text":"<p>Probably going to finish about a week early on YouTube talking about the innovations that are coming about in the early 20th century about cars and so it's become a real big part of American culture but electricity was one of the big driving forces of 20th century consumerism and remains so electricity industrial application for example the original street lights when major cities were built were gas lamps in 1906 something big happened does anybody know what happened in 1906? Do you impact in the United States. an earthquake. biggest on record: 9.4m\u00a0 up the the earthquake cause buildings to start falling but the underground means were ruptured for water lines which means San Francisco which really had one of the most state of the art fire fire systems were really really good but ultimately they couldn't get the buyers put out because the warming pool and when the gas means went up the fire spread throughout the city and they could not be contained they had to actually but the vast majority of San Francisco is either gutted by the earthquake or a firm to the ground and from that point on every city in America is going to rapidly try to get over onto electric lamps for their street lights the propellant for the rail so the electric rail cars become very common in cities another big thing that happened was a new changing building out anymore up and Technology made that possible because of electricity we have the technology to build these buildings 100 years ago 200 years built skyscrapers back in the early 1800s no problem but we didn't why why didn't you want a skyscraper back in the 1800s invented the elevator and even created a company that is still very much alive today we Otis Elevator companies to elev ators the world but down payment skyscraper Hospital s made them practical Saturdays the Empire State Building this time the Chrysler Building is built during this time also you see electric lights because now they can run 24 hours a day 7 days a week they don't have to shut down the machines are often using electricity too no longer are they using steamhouse you're starting to move over to Alexa electricity starts finding its way if you try to special comes more individual can't become the greatest lubricant for consumerism American has never seen electricity change the pattern of how Society functions on every level no longer are you high people talk about burning the fossil fuels carbon footprint and whatnot so we know that burning fossil fuels is not a good thing to retirement what do you know why you taking a class on environmental stud ies if you haven't I highly recommend you do what is the big thing about what is it released carbon monoxide requirements to people so it's an incredibly un healthy thing to burn coal in your house have those fumes go all over the place and be breathing in that carbon monoxide on a regular basis also has anybody ever burned Cold War yeah okay what's the residue like is it dry and ashy like wood okay there's a big difference between them Ash is nice and powdery you can brush it away it doesn't really make that big of a mess you can clean it up soot once you burn it it's this oily film that coats everything it's nasty okay so the soot now have you ever seen like Victorian era late 1800s homes and what they look like inside they have this really were heavy wallpaper dark oppressive color being in there feels like the house is going to fall on you you just feel the pressure of the darkness right you ever noticed that well there's a reason they put up those kinds of wallpaper on the walls it was to hide the corset if you have white balls they will turn gray faster than you can possibly imagine and good luck getting that stuff off the walls once it's there you can't get it off what's more you can't really paint over it because it's so oily you try putting paint on that it'll don't peel off thank you thank you okay so the suit is a problem also when you heat it a house by cold it would get warming up but it has a whole bunch of smaller more contained rooms now think about your house today he might have what a 3 or 4 bedroom house something like that go back then it wasn't uncommon to have a house about the size of a three or four bedroom house but they would have 8 to 10 bedrooms or room size things that they could kind of Niche off and why do they do that smaller so they're easier to heat up and the way you would do it as you'd get the coal burning and then you open up the doors one at a time to let the room heat up and then you close them and people would spend their time in those rooms but that meant there was a lot of family isolation people spend a lot of time alone electricity will change that for one thing once you start heating with electricity well first of all you don't have the fumes it's healthier also you don't need that really heavy oppressive wallpaper off the walls to paint your walls white it's light it's open you can breathe it's a whole lot better environment but the problem is building costs went up Not only was electricity coming into the house into the house at the same time indoor plumbing both of these were being integrated into Home Design at the same time and because of that the building costs of a large house Skyrocket because you're not just paying for the construction of the wall anymore now inside that wall you have to take the time to drill the holes pull the pipes weld them run cable put in plugs you have to do all that kind of stuff now so the the labor costs have gone up the supply cost you have to buy the pie chip to buy the wire you have to buy everything so the cost of home construction is going up dramatically so how do they keep the cost a little lower will you remember how they had all of these little individual rooms they get rid of those they don't need them anymore they were using those in order to hold the heat in from when you were feeding with Cole but now with electric heat you can use your rooms and keep it heated and fewer rooms fewer walls let's building material so This Is How They control keeping the heat so what does that do for the family people are used to being in their own little area aren't they and all of a sudden you get something called a family room a place where the family is now congregating like it or not those people are spending a lot more social time together so the families are interacting a lot more than they were social interaction goes up and so does Healthy Living also the new technology is being used for different types of Technology Appliance advances electricity Thomas Edison was brilliant at creating all sorts of consumer goods that make people's lives better and other start picking up on it too among these Innovations one of the first ones they pick is similar to what you have today but not quite the same if you look at washing machine back then you go oh my gosh they look like that basically it was a big tub on a frame like this and the tub spin but is that really so different from what we have you take off the outside casing on your washing machine that's kind of what it looks like now they had to fill it up manually and they had to drain it manual also there was no spin cycle to pull all the water out they just had to pull it up and ring it up but they didn't have to spend hours scrubbing it with the scrubber the washboards easy they cut hours of work down 2 minutes of work and that is a big big benefit for a lot of people another big one who's vacuums what do vacuums enable you to do now here in California it's not a big deal lots of people have hardwood floors we like them they're actually even more common than carpeting is in most places but let's say you're up in some place like Vermont or Colorado do you want hardwood floors in Colorado maybe if you've got a good heating system but if you're heating system you just don't run into the heat all the time and at night it might get cool what happens to the floor you ever get out of floor out of bed and put your feet on the floor and go ahead stuck so cold stuck to the floor at least you kind of feel that way well a lot of people in the colder climates are saying man these new vacuums are great I can cover my floor with the carpet and so they don't just have area rugs now that's what they use before the area rugs they didn't have vacuum cleaners before that's what they would do you heard of spring cleaning right well every spring they would take those area rugs out hang them over a clothesline and beat them with the stick until all the desk was out and then they part of their cleaning process now they don't have to do that they have a vacuum cleaner that can take care of cleaning so it makes that a whole lot easier but it makes the Advent of wall-to-wall carpet possible so another change in home design we'll do all carpeting becomes something that is very popular especially in the golden crimes another way that Home Design becomes safer with electricity Christmas time what do people bring into their homes at Christmas trees yes do you know how they decorated Christmas trees candles candles plus a dried out Christmas tree with needles falling all over the place may not be the best combination unless of course you're okay with burning your house down because that happened a lot so people had to be real careful with those sandals and there were a lot of house fires Merry Christmas you just burn down your house sound like fun that's me not to them either and electricity made Christmas a whole lot safer and a lot more colorful too one thing that it also does it starts widening the gap between urban and rural when we were talking about like the Scopes Monkey Trial and how far the urban versus rural Gap had gotten it wasn't just a gap it was the Grand Canyon at this point it was a chasm between urban and rural electricity causes that to expand all of those benefits that people in the cities get with electricity and people in the countryside aren't getting at least not yet now gradually they will get it but there is a growing gap between urban and rural and the urban people are looking at the rural people as people who are stuck in a previous pre-modern Society whereas the cities are moving ahead that's one reason that they had such contempt for the people in Tennessee when the Scopes trial is going on they looked at him as backwards they're stuck in the past they're unwilling to change and they need to be brought into the modern world that was the interpretation of the people in the cities World War II excuse me World War I sorry what's the big Turning Point and the personalization and from that point on you start getting a lot of different appliances so we talked about washing machines and vacuum cleaners those are certainly big sewing machines are another big one before that you had a trundle machine which is he had a foot pedal that you rocked back and forth that would sell so it was all mechanical Power based on you but once you have electricity you can simply hit a button and the thing starts going so that is a great Advantage for people using sewing machines and a lot of people made their own clothes back then so that wasn't uncommon a lot of people wanted that kitchen appliances were also very popular blenders mixers Electric coffee percolators another huge one electric iron to iron your clothes before that they have basically a piece of Steel that is more or less shaped like an iron but it has a wooden handle on it and you put it on top of a stove top and Let It Go problem here is if it gets too hot it'll burn your clothes if it doesn't get hot enough it won't get the wrinkles out so it was a real chore to get it just the right temperature and then once it was you immediately start ironing as quick as you can because it's cooling off as you speak and then you have to sit there and wait for it to heat back up again well electric irons made it possible for you to Simply set a thermostat exactly where you wanted it plug it in wait for it to heat up and then you can just fire all your stuff all at once no pausing no waiting and you never have to worry about it being too hot or too cold the iron is exactly the right temperature all the time that was a big bonus for people that made a huge difference in in the lives of people let's talk about refrigerators refrigerators were not really a 1920s thing they started coming out in the 30s but they still weren't very good it was really the World War II era where you start seeing Refrigeration become a lot more common and after the war refrigerators took off like crazy everybody wanted a new picture so World War II is really the turning point for electric refrigerators one of the most significant things to come out as a consumer item that will change America forever and continues to even to this day was something that was put out in 1920 now initially it was Nikola Tesla who came up with the idea behind this but he is not really credited with the invention The Invention instead was credited to a man named Marconi and that invention is the radio 1920 was The Big Year for radio that's when it came out first radio station was KDKA Pittsburgh you think that the first radio station are probably been in New York nope Pittsburgh Pennsylvania the first commercial radio broadcast that they put out was in November of 1920 what do you think it might have been what happens in November Christmas nope there's something else that happens in November yeah Thanksgiving does happen think earlier and think every two to four years 19 the presidential election they're covering the presidential election between Warren G Harding who won at Cox the guy who didn't this was the first partial radio broadcast covering the presidential election however to give you an idea of how long it will take for America to be fully inundated with radio by the end of the 1930s just before World War 2 there are 41 million radios operating in America that's more than an average of one per household that's huge that's a lot of radios that are out there so a lot of people own two or more radios radios are significant because they make a truly National listening audience possible you can reach an entire nation worth of people with radios that's the real power of this and think of that from a consumerism standpoint who takes advantage of being able to reach that many people you want to sell stuff what do you need commercials advertising advertisers are going to be a big part of the rapid expansion of radio okay so the first broadcast came out in November of 1920 a little over half a year later in July of 21 you have another type of broadcast happen the first one was Politics the second one will be Sports and the Sports Broadcast that was huge was the world heavyweight boxing championship between Jack Dempsey and George Carpentier the boxing match reached the largest listening audience up to that point 300,000 listeners approximately that was pretty good considering radio's been around for not even a year 300,000 people were able to tune in and listen to that by October we were at July there we jump forward October just a few months later what big sporting event happens in October 10th and Amy Sports bands out there no Sportsman you guys suck not football World Series yes please he can balance your checkbook while you're watching baseball okay so baseball the World Series was hugely popular and it had a great success in being broadcast all the games of the World Series were broadcast on radio and they all had fantastic listening audience by December of 1921 so good first radio broadcast is offering so over the course of a year it went from 1 to 10 that's not bad for the first year considering people have to get started they have to get set up and they have to start broadcasting 6 months later by June of 22 100 stations are operating by December of that year 350 radio stations are operating see what's happening the significance of radio was very very fast to explode this is at a time when it took time for people to do things well that's changing the speed at which change is being embraced is remarkable during this period of time and the sales of radio and radio Parts also dramatically sure you just how big of a financial impact this has in America from a consumerism in 1922 alone 60 million dollars and that was $60 million back then so that's a huge amount of money 60 million was spent in 1922 on radios and radio parts the next year 1923 125 million it doubled it's blowing up in here now is there anybody in here who does not have a radio you don't have a radio you have a car huh it's not really your car okay but you're driving it right so it's basically your radio okay we all got them there's radios all around us all the time so this is something that is still very much part of current American society well this is when it really kicks into the year so we've talked about politics and then sports but it's not long before they figure out the signific ance now up to this point music is not what their programming for but if I were to ask you why do you turn on the radio today do you do it for the news do you do it for any entertainment shows novelty acts dramas that you're listening to what do you listen to music yeah music it becomes the major staple of radio but early on that's not what it was used for you see before you have dialed on your radio now where you can tune into an exact frequency digitally they didn't have that they had a little knob that you moved back and forth and you just have to kind of kind of nudge it a little bit to dial it in so it's nice and clear get rid of the static as much as possible it's something you just kind of had to bust with but radio stations didn't always broadcast on the same exact place on the radio band so one day it might be over here the next day it might be here the next day it might be here and you have to go find their spot on the dial so how do you do it well then I'll tell you we're going to be playing the World Series on the radio here well people want to be there for the start of the game right if you want to be there for the start you have to be able to tune in early so they would play music before the event that they are scheduling so that people can tune in and listen to the music and then when the event starts they're already in place that's what they were using music for but pretty soon a lot of radio broadcasters found that people were actually listening to the music program started they would switch stations and listen to another one that was using the lead in music and they go people are really listening to the music rather than the program and this game rise to stations playing exclusive music well that's all they did music over the radio brings a big change to America the music that they first start playing are Symphonies and operas now you probably go oh gosh that's boring well for people who are not used to listening to music at all who gets position to Symphonies and and operas wealthy the elite they're the ones who go to Carnegie Hall and listen to the New York Symphony and fill our mind they're the ones who go here La Boheme the Opera being performed they're the ones who can afford that the upper middle class can make their way into that below that it really falls off quick and unless you're an absolute fanatic and you save up a lot to go most people don't have access to that for radio suddenly crosses the money boundary introducing Opera and Symphony to people who have never really had a chance to appreciate it and they love it what's more they're inspired by it they hear it and they go wow I want to do some of that this is cool and so it gives rise to people learning how to play instruments ordinary people that normally wouldn't up to now who learned how to play instruments like the piano or the violin yeah oh you're going I did yeah but up to that point only the wealthy could afford to do that that's a big benefit the 1920s are known especially for what kind of music jazz good yes it's known as the Jazz Age but Radio broadcasters typically avoid Jazz why what were the negative associations with jazz black people there's a racism component okay who listens to Jazz the kids the young adults and what are they doing when they're listening to Jazz exactly they're sinning with an ending yes they are dancing lasciviously with each other they're wearing scanty clothes of flappers all of this is associated where are they doing it the plugs where they are serving what alcohol is illegal prohibition they're drinking alcohol and good girls who shouldn't be smoking in public are lighting up so jazz is associated with immorality on a big scale and it really isn't until the late 20s and early 30s where you see Jazz start moving on to the radio by 30s it will be the big type of music that is on the radio big bands emerge in the 1930s and people love it it catches on so do the 30s and 40s Jazz will become the most popular type of music that is being broadcast but it doesn't appeal to everybody there are people in other places of the country that don't like jazz or whatever reason maybe they just don't like the sound of it maybe it doesn't speak to them as a matter of fact they don't like Symphonies because it's hoity toity they don't like offer because hey they're singing in a different language and I can't even understand them okay they don't like jazz well that's the city folks what do they like they like gospel they like bluegrass they like Hill Music they like both music they like local types of music that speak to their individual culture in their little locality and all of these little rural types of music combined with gospel start coalescing into one main type of music has a lot of different ways it is expressed but it's all grouped together and called country in 1920s so country music becomes incredibly popular but as part of that gospel is also very popular you hear a lot of religious programming during this period time Gospel Music and on Sundays they will start broadcasting church services now you remember how when we were talking about 20s during during the religion section how we said a lot of people stop attending church and I said there's more reasons than just people becoming anti-religious well this is the other reason the radio starts broadcasting church services and a lot of people start waking up on Sunday going oh man I don't want to get ready and go down to church or I'm not feeling that well I just want to listen to church on the radio and so they'll go down to their living room tune in the radio and listen to church there so rather than going to church church comes to them so it's not that so many people are becoming anti-religious although there are a lot of them in the twenties you do but a lot of those numbers of defining Church attendance is due to the radio the radio has a big impact and in fact the radio becomes a very powerful tool for religion ministers who suddenly went from local revivalist preachers to evangelists like William Jennings Bryan Billy Sunday are there still our televangelists still on TV oh yeah they're there you go down to the South and you'll see a lot of those programs that's big there okay so there's a lot of different types of radio programming that's coming out but one big problem was that it was absolutely chaotic it was crazy stuff was all over the place Radio broadcasters would free would change frequencies like people change clothes one day they're over here the next day they're over there people don't know where to find them on the dial also some broadcasters are only putting out maybe 10,000 watts of power others are coming in broadcasting it 100,000 watts of power and then somebody comes along and his broadcasting at 5 million watts of power blowing out everybody anywhere near their frequency they know over other people they mow over those other stations and the radio industry starts doing something that is very very rare in American Business they are begging the government to regulate governments don't businesses typically don't like the government messing with their business they want them to stay out of that well this is one case where you actually see the industry ask for that regulation because it needed it desperately and the government was very quick to respond to that the federal radio app the radioactive 1927 was a very significant piece of legislation because he created America's regulatory body or radio waves and that was the Federal radio Commission later on the federal radio commission will be expanded and renamed to the Federal Communication Commission bfcc and the SEC is still the regulatory body for any kind of aired material they set new standards for all broadcasters this was good news but it was also bad news because the people they listen to are the people with money the big high-powered radio stations that have lots of money they were the ones who got things their way which means the little smaller more independent ones the big radio stations got the prime spots in the center of the dial if you were a small broadcaster you were pushed out to the margins let me ask you something do they still do that kind of yeah you see a lot of the other less popular ones wind up somewhere down around 87.3 or up around 107.9 or 108.1 if you have 108 you know you're really French that's way out there on the diet and that's where these smaller stations are being relegated to whereas the big ones are kept in the middle so the middle of the dial tended to be where people would look and they very rarely went that hurt the smaller programs so this is forwarding business interest s commercial interests would be forwarded and they would Thrive under this system but the one thing it does do it brings necessary order to an absolutely crazily chaotic now in 1926 shortly before this regulation was put in there was an interesting innovation in the world of radio the big radio company at this point in time was radio Corporation of America RCA and RCA teams up with another big company to produce a company jointly that they both own a pizza that other company that they came up with is American Telephone and Telegraph AT&amp;T still around today what it does AT&amp;T do what's their business team up with a telephone line company they can link up radio stations over telephone lines over bass distances and broadcast the same program nationally yeah they create what becomes known as a radio network and that Network that they created the National Broadcasting Company NBC NBC the first big Network not just in the United States we did it first here the first lash up that they create was a 4-Hour program they advertise it locally then it's going to be at a certain time and they encourage people to tune in as much as they were hoping they got far more than they ever dreamed the average estimate estimated this audience for that broadcast it was 4 hours long it had a lot of different components music comedy various various different programs in there 12 million people there's never been an audience that big before that was not possible before Radio Networks and this was only their first attempt they only had 10 stations linked up with this 12 million can you imagine what they can do if they start linking up more well they found out the next year 1927 something very significant happened in the world have you heard of Charles Lindbergh he's the guy who first solo piloted across the Atlantic Ocean that's what he's famous for well NBC covered the flight they used a massive radio Lasha over their Network they linked more than 50 radio stations in 24 States which was more than half of the United States that one over 30 million people tuned in to follow Charles Lindbergh and something happened because of that we got our first radio Superstar celebrity based on radio this it already seen movie stars approach but this is the first big Radio Star who emerged from Radio something else that happens is that stuff to people who want to buy stuff consumers find that this is an advertising dream come true being able to reach 30 million people and captive audience like NBC can do can you imagine what advertisers are thinking the profits that they are imagining pill comparison to the reality of what they're actually achieving they're dreaming here they're achieving here they soon learn the incredible power of advertising over Radio Networks advertising Begins by sponsoring individual shows if you have a product you want to sell you try to Target your audience based on a particular type of show if you're trying to sell cleaning products to Housewives you want to Target a show that Housewives listen to make sense and so Men start coming up with these ideas well what is it that women want to listen to I bet they'd like shows on child care tips gardening and the women are going really you're joking right what is it that women wanted to listen to and once they figured that out sponsors started blocking to them because they were hugely popular with women and the companies that really associated with those Ivory so Ivory sponsored these kinds of Serial dramas and so did other cleaning company so much popularity came out of it they came they soap operas that's where the term soap opera comes from stop being so they still call him soap operas still very much alive call broadcasts we're also something that we're very popular if you had something you wanted to broadcast but you didn't want to actually start a station you just wanted to put out a show you can pay for airtime there were stations that would sell airtime to you so you could do that as well however the big Advertiser who really figured out how to do it right leave it to the cigarette company they are the Geniuses when it comes to advertising and we will see that time and again cigarette companies know how to sell a product and the company that really figures it out during this period of time was a company called Lucky Strike which was pretty much the biggest cigarette company in America very popular he can still get up what is it their app well men there's no problem with them smoking but there's a social stigma against women smoking in public right this is what they want to take on if they can get rid of that stigma it means women will be buying cigarettes as much as men do and that means they sell more cigarettes they make more money so they want to go after the female Marketplace or cigarettes so the first thing they do is say well we need to take away this stigma to make it not be a negative thing for women to smoke so how do we do that Opera had become very popular in America by this point people knew the opera stars by name they were famous they were International celebrities and most of the big opera singers were from Europe in America Europeans have something sort of like a an era of sophistication that people in America just feel it left and so when you tap into European ideas they tend to have a little bit more refinement they're a little more highbrow and so by getting opera singers from Europe to endorse their products they are tying into that idea well these are people of High Society they are people who are good decent upper echelon and their opera singers which means they make their living singing so clearly if they're smoking there must be nothing wrong with it it's perfectly safe and it's clearly not something that is to be ground on morally if the elites over there or upper singers are smoking it must be okay and that starts changing some attitudes but were they really strike gold they sell cigarettes to women by saying this will help you want to maintain your figure you want to keep the weight off smoke Lucky Stripes does that work now how many of you have smoked and I'm not talking about the guns yes it works why because cigarettes aren't oral fixation so instead of picking up something to eat you light up a cigarette you're not taking in calories you ask any smoker who has ever gone through the problem of breaking the addiction and quitting as soon as they quit cigarettes they say man I gave 20 pounds in a month on something that's why somebody got smokers are constantly too gum it's so that they're not eating something because it's just packing on the pounds so yes cigarettes do deal with that also cigarettes have some kind of a chemical reaction in your brain that tends to lessen your cravings for food have your oral fixation cigarettes do that you know what you crave with cigarettes coffee that's what you think and coffee unless you're putting all kinds of crap in it is not terribly happening drink it black you're fine so very effective for that other things that we're significant Radio starts blurring boundaries that have traditionally been maintained for racial lines segregated black and white are on different sides segregation is very much part of America but an interesting radio program comes along and I will say from the get-go that if you were to listen to this radio program today you would be offended it is very racially off cold okay there's a lot of prejudices in there there's a lot of negative stereotypes in there but at the same time it has a solid listening audience in both the black and white communities alike why the program now keep in mind the 1920s When the Ku Klux Klan was rising and there was so much violence being directed toward African Americans fleeing from that a lot of them will move out of the South up to Northern cities or out west in California and when they do that they experience something of a culture shop and Amos and happy it's two men from Georgia who move up to Chicago and when they get there experiencing the big city up North for the first time they go through all sorts of Highly amusing very entertaining cultural classes you know it's it's a they don't quite understand everything and so a lot of the culture of the South is involved a lot of the stereotypes of blacks are involved but enough of them can identify with the humor that despite the racism and keep in mind they're used to the racism they get it every day when they're out there people are always looking down on them because of their race so they're used to that but they can identify with the situation that these two guys remember that yeah and all of a sudden you have a listening audience finish Crossing racelands this is starting to blur the line between white culture and Black Culture they're starting to mix in certain ways this is going to set the still set the tone for some of the innovations that come later World War II isn't far off and World War II really kicks the Civil Rights Movement into high gear that's the picture when we enter the 1930s we see something else happen out in Germany there's this guy named Hitler and Hitler is one of the most genius users of radio the world had ever seen he can sell the big lie so effectively that he teaches other people how to sell by his very approach of selling his ideas to people government propaganda propaganda is nothing more than a sales pitch by your government to get people to buy an idea that's what they're doing they're advertising thought how you think propaganda becomes bit well killer is using it in a very negative and destructive way but he is heavily influencing somebody else in our country Franklin Delano Roosevelt Roosevelt is a is elected in 1932 when the Great Depression was at its very lowest point people were desperate and Roosevelt understands the need to communicate with the people not just to talk at them not to talk above them not to give speeches the people don't need that and Roosevelt delivers them he creates a weekly radio show called the Fireside Jets and hey I'm just your friendly neighbor another fellow American just like and I'm coming here to talk with you today about what your country this week we were working on fixing the banking system so that when you put your money in the bank you know it's going to be safe that's what we're trying to do we're working to figure you and then the next week hey we came up with two new jobs programs there are now 7 million more jobs available in the country because of this and if you are out of work you should look into this people finally felt reconnected the Great Depression demoralized America everybody was wondering if this is the downfall of the country maybe capitalism maybe modernity maybe America as a whole just isn't going the right direction look at all the great Great Depression brought just a huge impact into people's lives in a very negative way but Roosevelt restored their faith the New Deal program that he came out with that was meant to fix the Great Depression get improved things but it wasn't the New Deal that got America out of the depression before too but was it successful anyway yes and the reason because of the Fireside Chats the Roosevelt was using to sell his ideas to the American people he got them not to give up to maintain hope to stay focused on what their government was trying to do for them and that they work ignoring the problems of the masses they knew that there were problems and they were actively working to help them Roosevelt convinced them that that help was coming and it kept America in one piece they didn't give up and Chuck it all another big thing that came out the third that was huge and still is huge today news programming news programs were not done in the 20 first of all to run a news program effectively it takes money a lot of money because you got to go out and get that news you have to gather it you have to organize it then you have to broadcast and that takes a lot to ever hind you had to have a lot of funding behind but in the 1930s people are nervous about what's going on in the world think about this the Soviet Union is on the rise during the Great Depression the Soviet Union looks like the only country in the world that actually is working everybody else is disastrous but here you have a communist country going like crazy and then Hitler comes in he starts modernizing Germany even more and he starts ignoring all the treaty provisions and people are going hey this guy sounds like he's pretty good and then he starts invading people taking up bits and pieces of their country they're going and then they see mussoline and he's giving these big bombastic speeches and setting people out to conduct violence on others to get the government doing what he wants to do and then there's Franco in Spain another fascist dictate people are standing wow what's happening and at the same time you have Japan spreading the greater East Asia cup Prosperity spear cross the Eastern Pacific and a lot of people are gone what's happening we need to know what's going on the news people are desperate to hear what's happening now and news programming becomes huge to show you how huge it got in 1938 one of the most significant radio programs of all time was air there was a filmmaker a guy who is famous for creating what Hollywood typically consid greatest movies ever made does anybody know what Hollywood considers that movie you're on the right direction well Orson Welles comes up with he wants to put out a pseudo news program but he wants to tell it as a story kind of like it's breaking news what is the story he's telling aliens are invading America an alien invasion this is a story he's telling and the name of that program was called War of the Worlds it is arguably the most famous single radio program of all time that's how significant that works now he starts out with the disclaimer he tells people what you were about to hear is for entertainment purposes only this is not a real news broadcast so please do not take it seriously it's 100 but if you tune in just a little late you tune into a news broadcast it's talking about aliens coming in oh my gosh they just blew up the White House oh there goes to Capital and people freaked it caused a massive hysteria across the country people are going oh my gosh but afterwards Hollywood found something that they really like I mean they'd already made a couple science fiction movies but after this science fiction movies are going to be big people love them because they're fascinated with aliens is that still true do we still have movies talking about aliens lots of them so he definitely Taps into something here but it also demonstrates just how significant news broadcast had been in people's lives they relied on that information they needed it news programming was trustable is it anymore not right now not in this climate they put out what they want people to hear not necessarily what is actually happening so take news programs with a grain of salt these days there's post people on multiple sides of multiple issues all trying to convince you to think of things their way News broadcasting was reliable it was trustable because people needed that news and so they tried to do it as well as they could possibly do it somewhere along the line we lost track of that and it was probably about 2004 2008 somewhere in there we're become less and less reliable so that is a good place to stop and on Monday we will move into World War II have a good weekend I'll see you then</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%202/1460%20Feb%201/","title":"1460 Feb 1","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Rise and fall of africanized

and cool deposits but not nearly enough to do the full industrialization so Carnegie gets to sell them all kinds of stuff also Japan has no oil none they have to import it and who's importing the oil to them Rockefeller okay so the industrialist here are providing all of the resources all of the machines all of the things that takes in Japan to industrialize really quickly in Japan has an exclusive deal with the United States now the us is under no Illusions Britain France Germany a whole bunch of other countries are all lined up behind us and we want to sell stuff to you too in Japan saying no no we have a good agreement with the United States but how long will that good agreement last if America starts discriminating against the immigrants from Japan it's in their best interest to keep Japan happy because then the industrialists make more money and that ultimately is why the Japanese end up being different they come in different first of all the people who are coming in are coming in with means they're not coming in broke and desperate at least not most of them most of them are coming in with money and a plan they want to own land that's something they can't have at home and with that they are coming with the intent that they are going to settle here permanently this is a permanent move they are leaving Japan to come to America and they are embracing America as their new country they still love their Heritage but this is going to be their home now so this is a conscious choice on their behalf to do this that makes them very different than a lot of immigrants who are coming in at this time they come in with me and they want to own land okay as they start settling in pressure starts ramping up on the politicians here in California can't you do anything to restrict them the politicians are stuck between a rock and a hard place here okay the position they're in is this if they don't pass laws the people are going to vote them out and replace them with people who do pass laws but if they do pass laws they're going to upset everybody in the federal government and major corporations and they don't want to do that either so they do the only thing they can do they pass laws that sound impressive and it sounds like they are making a genuine attempt to restrict the Japanese but they create loophole so big you can drive a freight train through it huge loophole these are what are called Paper Tigers that's what they do they create Paper Tigers they have a big Roar but no teeth and when California starts passing these laws that supposedly are intended to restrict the Japanese people back home at Japan are saying hey what is that what is California doing to to those people there we hear about all these laws and the ambassadors don't worry they can't make them stick this doesn't actually do anything it's public relations this is a way to keep the Hot Heads pacified and still give all the Japanese people all the freedom that they need to operate and Japan goes okay we can understand that they have to essentially save things and that's something that is very much part of Japanese culture so as long as they're not being imposed upon but then California tries to do some other restrictive things now when I say segregation especially in schools where do you picture Alabama Mississippi places in the Deep South right big segregation do you immediately think of California as being a state that was big on segregation is segregated to they just didn't necessarily focus on African Americans they segregated a lot of the Spanish-speaking population ostensibly because they said well because they speak Spanish they wouldn't do well in English schools so therefore they should be in their own schools so they were able to justify keeping especially the Mexican population out of the white school system but they also segregated the Chinese out saying well they don't really speak English either they speak Chinese therefore they should be segregated out they tried the same thing with the Japanese when the Japanese wanted to send their kids to the American schools and at that point the president stepped in and said no you can segregate anybody else out you want but the Japanese go to White schools and they were so stunned at this I mean this wasn't a well let's talk about it this was an absolute no we're drama line there and they just kind of went so we're just supposed to take it I thought we were supposed to no the Japanese go to White schools and that was it the Japanese were sort of the exception to the rules they put up all these other barriers but the Japanese students went to the white schools now they had this cry out about how the yellow Peril had started up again that's what they referred to the Chinese way of immigrants during and a little bit after the Gold Rush was the yellow Peril and they start saying well the yellow pearls starting up again no matter how loud they complained the federal government did not budge and as a result the Japanese as a group fared far better as immigrants than most of the other immigrants save those from Western Europe tours if you're a Western European Protestant you're welcome to open arms but if you or anyone else immediately you're downgrade Catholic Eastern European Japanese who came in not only had means but they were usually very literate very educated and they valued that education for their kids too and as a result they were successfully able to get their kids brought into those schools yes I don't know if that actually happened or not I couldn't answer that I haven't heard of any cases where that was true generally speaking the Chinese once they were ghettoized they tended to keep to themselves and they didn't usually out of self-preservation they didn't want to be seen Crossing those lines because they were caught they can open themselves up to all kinds of things including being deported so I haven't heard of any of those but it's possible that somebody did along the way at some point so the Japanese had a distinct advantage over most of the other immigrant groups all the way up until something changes World War II World War 2 completely upended the Japanese experience here in the United States they went from basically having a favorite status among immigrant groups at least legally speaking to being stripped of just about everything when the war started all sorts of outcry against the Japanese especially here in California but Nationwide really said well all these people who are Japanese in America are automatically a threat they could be saboteurs they could be spies we need to do something about them now Jennifer Hoover head of the FBI is the guy who is the one in charge of counterintelligence he's the one in charge of maintaining National Security and when he sits down and talks with Roosevelt he says we don't really have a problem with them the problem is with us now if you want to round them up for any number of reasons I would support but ultimately what's going to happen in this war he knows that in order to keep people focused on the war to keep them motivated he needed to make him angry he needed to feed that anger and that means that the propaganda is going to really upset people make them Focus make them want to stay pro war track so that they keep everybody going the same direction make sense okay so if you're going to ramp up the rhetoric and really focus on how bad the Japanese are and the Japanese are still very identifiably in the American public in the culture among the population everybody knows who they are they would become instant targets Roosevelt does something very controversial Executive Order 9066 the internment of Japanese during World War 2 the Japanese are rounded up and put in internment camps for the duration of the war now they could explain this to the American people well were were avoiding any possibility that some kind of subversive action may be done but for the Japanese they can explain the saying we're really trying to protect you because people are going to be really angry during the war and they might take that out on you personally and by putting you all together during the war until it's over that is safer for all of you and as a result you don't see a lot of Japanese resistance the Japanese however when they got out of the camps after the war was over a lot of them went back and found that their homes were being lived in by other people there whatever their possessions were gone they lost everything there are some people who were able to maintain their land when the Japanese internment was announced a lot of the Japanese had neighbors who were friends and who thought that this was a big Injustice After all keep in mind the Japanese had been here for you know for the most part 40 years thereabouts in other words the people who are living here some are first generation but most are second generation if you are born in the United States are you Japanese anymore no 75% of the Japanese were rounded up and put in the internment camps are American citizens and they are entitled to the same protection from their government as everyone else and here after the war they find their stuff has been Stripped Away some people were able to work with their neighbors to put their land in the hands of the legal hands of their neighbors and after the war they were able to get it back but most people lost everything they were able to get some compensation from the government after the war but it was a pittance compared to what they lost so this was pretty devastating to a lot of people following the war the racism against the Japanese will persist okay you're going to see anti-japanese sentiments come after the war and a good portion of that is because of the way the Empire of Japan behaved during the war there were a lot of atrocities against Americans especially early on when Japan was taking over the territories and then treating the prisoners very very poorly starving them feeding him to death all kinds of things happen the Baton Death March was something that really and they don't separate the fact that this is going on by an extremist Japanese government versus the people who have been living here all their lives they are Americans and so that disconnect is something that will take time to get over okay there's another group that you can call them immigrants but they're not exactly immigrants sounds funny doesn't it and that is the Filipinos in 1898 the United States went to war with Spain it was a war that we won and when we won it we took a lot of Spain's possessions in the Pacific away from them especially the Philippines the Philippines had been a big Colony a forward base in Asia for Spain to trade and we just take it over we basically make it our first colony that's when America becomes an Empire but in doing so it means all the people who are in the Philippines are now officially Americans by extension they have the same rights as Americans they have citizenship they have the right same rights that Americans have and that means if they want to come to America technically legally at that point the Philippines is an American territory therefore they want to come to America there's no restriction they're not really immigrating they're simply moving to a different part of the country get it but during this. Of time you see a lot of Filipinos come in and again they're coming into the West Coast they're coming in largely to California a lot of them go into the same places that Mexicans are largely Central Valley areas where there's agricultural work to be done so you see them go into those areas as well also keep in mind that some of the backlash against the Filipinos is the same back last you getting get against others beings as they were colonized by the Spanish what language do they speak Spanish good what religion do they practice they're Catholic they're Catholic and there's a backlash against that too but there's no way for them to restrict them so they know that the the complaints about the Filipinos will just be falling on deaf ears so the Filipinos while they face discrimination they don't face limitations to their immigration they see that to being from Asia being Spanish speakers being Catholics but that's the same kind of thing that a lot of other groups are getting to but they're still a fairly significant group that move into the US dreams. Okay let's talk about a different group here for now we talked about nativism now we're moving on and going to talk about Native Americans now do you remember the catch phrase for nativism America for Real Americans think Native Americans might be kind of going haha yeah who are The Real Americans we are you took the place from us so nativism kind of has a funny connotation with them Native Americans as Europeans start coming into the Americas and they start displacing Native Americans the Europeans have what becomes known as an Indian problem that is once you put the Indians out of their territory and take it over for yourself what do you do with the ones who are displaced the Indian problem well for the Europeans it was it was a pretty simple matter that is most of the people here in the English colonies of Mainland North America practice what was known as separation keep them over there and we stay over here and as the colonies expanded a little bit they simply pushed that line out a little further so they said well now we're up to here but you stay over there we'll stay over here and then they expand a little further well you stay over there we'll stay over here and that's kind of how the English dealt with it they expanded where it was opportune for them but they knew that it was a limited thing they weren't going to go all the way out to the West Coast when the United States takes over however the United States has some vision of the possibility of creating a continental government a nation of Continental proportions and really it's when Thomas Jefferson gets in that they really think that this is going to be a reality so when the United States takes over and it basically inherits the English system and have to figure out what they're going to do with it they have to confront the Indian problem as well there are four basic approaches in dealing with the Indian problem and all of them have been used at one time or another during the interaction between Europeans and Native Americans so what exactly are they well first make the list what are the four ways somebody give me one of the things the Europeans can do in their relation with Native Americans were pushed off their land what do you do with them ideas what's that assimilation make them part of our society yes that is one of them this is saying we can make them part of the United States they can become American citizens and be part of this larger country so just because we're kicking off their land doesn't mean they can't be part of America they can be part of America so let's make America assimilation what else might be enough option for them okay reservations are sort of part of a separation ideology okay they're over there we're over here this is something the English have been doing and a lot of people were wondering if maybe they should continue a lot of people Envision that the United States would only go out as far as the Mississippi River and so a lot of people have this idea that well maybe everything west of the Mississippi would be Indian country and everything east of the Mississippi would be the United States and so some people were playing with this idea saying well the Indians can have all the land out there and we can have all the land over here and you know maybe maybe that'll work so separation ideology went through a lot of different transformation we'll talk about some what else could you do with the Native Americans that have been displaced yeah reservations that's kind of in the separation category that just gives them a destination do you think that the people in charge of the United States are going to compensate them at all for anything probably not they're not looking at giving things to the Native Americans they're looking at ways to take things from them and keep them while dealing with the people that they're displacing so what exactly can they do with those people they can make them part of society they can separate them from society but there's two more possibilities what else could they do yeah they could well they could try but deporting them to where I mean they live here so deporting somebody means sending them back home but they're already home so you're kicking them off of their land so but it's possible you can ship them off somewhere I suppose but that would typically fall into the separation ideology too what else huh wipe them out annihilation slightly more Extreme as we go what's this one what's that slavery enslavement yes that is number three yes those are the four big ways of dealing with the Indian problem from the European perspective now the United States is coming to grips with well if we kick the Indians off of their land and we keep kicking them off and we maintain this separation what happens when we've expanded so far there's nowhere to kick him off too what do we do with them then so some people are already asking the question what if there's no place for them to go we've been pushing them on to land that we don't have yet but eventually what if we take it all over what do we do with them and George Washington was the first one really in government that said maybe we should try making them Americans so he is actually shifting from the English approach of Separation up to and assimilation idea he says Indians are actually highly intelligent very hardworking and industrious and if we work with them we can get rid of the negative parts of their culture as they saw it and replace it with an American one they can be Real Americans like us notice the Assumption of superiority but what are these things really Justified there's an assumption for European Americans at this point that they deserve that land. The Indians are less deserving. They aren't putting it to good use therefore we have a right even a responsibility to take that land away from them so that we can use it better than they do. Principle of highest and best use says if you have land but you're not using it then it really is more rightfully our land because we will use it better than you so we are justified in kicking you out\u00a0its called the principle of highest use. Ultimately this is a smoke screen this is pure on a date pure unadulterated at the heart of they're trying to justify their Landry this is a land graft okay so when it comes to enslavement has that been tried?\u00a0 Jamestown settlers tried it with no success. The Carolina settlers the people who came up from the Caribbean and they were the first ones who really brought slaves in they had this idea well why don't we sell the slaves off into the Caribbean? We know we can't enslave them locally but we can make some money by selling them down there and some will enslave the local Native Americans and ship them out to the Caribbean. So that was done on a limited scale. Trafficking them as slaves. Others will engage in wiping them out. So all of these things are things that have been tried at some point by someone. But when the United States takes over and they have to come up with the First Federal Indian policy that is the official policy of how the American government is going to deal with the Indian problem. The first one becomes the civilization policy they want to civilize the Indians. And the Indians are saying what are you saying we're not civilized? Civilized than you what exactly do you mean when you want to civilize us? Well what do they mean?\u00a0 What do they see that they don't like? Clothing and\u00a0hair cut your hair where European stuff close or for women wear dresses. Be respectful.\u00a0 What else do they have to do if they're going to be civilized?\u00a0 What's that? Yes convert to Christianity missionaries go in and force. And the missionaries find that some of the best way to do that is how? Schools. Education. Now that takes us into a different direction you have to learn English if you're going to be educated. It's civilized to be speaking English and they say it now wait a minute here. The French don't speak English. Are they civilized? At this point America has to sort of back pedal well of course their civilized but well they have a writing system just like we do but you don't have a writing system therefore it's really best that you speak English so that you can learn how to read and write too. So what you're really saying is it's not our language you have a problem with it's the fact that we don't have a writing system. Okay we'll create a writing system. The civilization project just went on its first tangent okay and basically they tried setting up a pilot system where five tribes were put into the civilization program all of them were in the southeastern United States. The Cherokee are the most famous of them but the five were the Cherokee Creek Seminoles the choctaws and the chickasaws those five all went through similar experiences. So they are even still referred to today as the Five Civilized Tribes because they went through the civilization program. Now, A guy by the name of Sequoiyah. Sequoia he was a Cherokee man who invented a new writing system for the Cherokee language it's called a syllabary which basically gives a specific symbol for a sound that is made in the language and he created a very good readable language that is still utilized today in the Cherokee territory they have a Cherokee newspaper that is printed in both English and in Cherokee which is kind of an interesting thing so this is still very much alive form of writing okay so they have to live like Americans dress like Americans cut their hair go to school be educated and most of them in fact you learn English and learn how to read and write in English and they go to English schools English speaking schools what else well remember the issue that the Europeans had with women doing the farming is it okay if you're going to be civilized men have to do the farm and the men just kind of look at him you realize you just asked us to wear a dress right that's how it was to them it was like they just told all the men they had to be women they said okay let's say we go along with this we don't think it's a good idea but all right we're listening keep going well you have to grow things on your Farms the way Europeans do single crop agriculture focus on a single crop now the Indians were known for rotating their crops through the advantage doesn't complete the soil and the Europeans are basically forcing them to take a big step back because single crop agriculture depletes the soil over time your way we'll do it that way ultimately they will start forming the same way Americans in the South do now what Americans in the south do as far as agriculture at this point what's their big single crop agriculture? By this. Of time cotton has become the dominant form of single prop agriculture tobacco started America but it's kind of depleted the soil and they're phasing it out and selling the slaves down to the cotton areas well that's what they do they start cutting plantations they grow cotton they buy slaves they speak English they dress like the English Americans do they're doing everything that they are told they even create American style tribal governments that have their own tribal Constitution and they function according to the same basic Democratic Republican standards the United States they're trying to do everything exactly right however what is the big purpose of this remember what I said what do Europeans want land and the whole idea here behind the civilization program was to move them over to one more thing individual land ownership why easier to get the land away from one person than it is to get the land away from a whole big group of people you have to convince an entire tribe to give a plan they can't get people to do that unless it's at the point of a gun they know this but if they can convince the people that individual land ownership is what it means to be a real American then they can get that individual ownership and eventually gradually that land will be opened up for whites to own. And they'll be able to do without violence. That's the idea behind the civilization program however as soon as they float the idea of individual land ownership this is where all five of the Civilized Tribes put their foot down and say no as a matter of fact they've established these new governments and they actually start passing new laws through those governments and those laws basically are called blood loss blood loss blood loss are past and they say if any individual tries to sell tribal land without the tribes approval they will be executed you can be put to death for trying to sell tribal land that's what a blood law is things start really heating up as white settlers start settling onto Cherokee land basically hear all of the Cherokee land is just really Prime cotton growing land and the Cherokees who are growing cotton and buying slaves and running their own plantations and whites are looking at that going man how come this is in the hands of Indians this should be an hour hand notice the Assumption of superiority whites start settling onto Cherokee land and starting up cotton plantations and the Cherokee do everything correctly they go to the governor of Georgia and see could you please get people off our land we have a treaty with the United States that says this land is ours and you've got white settlement on it governor of Georgia refuses says no take that up with the government of the us we have no part in that and we refuse to get involved in the presidency at this particular point was Andrew Jackson now Andrew Jackson what's his View regarding yeah he didn't particularly like Native Americans and he definitely doesn't like the idea of Native Americans holding on to that land remember after the war of 1812 he was one of the people going around forcing Native Americans at gunpoint basically to sign their land over to the United States he has absolutely no interest in seeing that land stay in the hands of Native Americans say well the only thing we can do is go through the system that's the only way we can operate in a civilized manner some people are saying no no we are we ought to rise up no no they take it up through the federal court system and two cases go all the way to the Supreme Court Worcester view Georgia and Cherokee Nation be Georgia and both cases the Chief Justice Marshall writes the opinion on both of them and both of them besides with Cherokee he says the Cherokee have a legitimate grievance they've got a legitimate treaty here and it's clear these people are violating their territory the US government needs to get rid of them Jackson's response well Mr Marshall has written his opinion let's see him in force and Jackson refuses to remove them now was Jackson operating legally no if the people of America at that point in time wanted to get rid of Jackson and impeach him did they have grounds yes but he wasn't impeached you know why because most Americans agreed with Jackson they felt that that land in the hands of Indians was a waste and that the sooner they got rid of all that land from Indian control and put it into white American control so they actually saw this as a good thing that Jackson was ignoring the Supreme Court the Cherokees who went through the civilization program the guys who ran cotton plantations with slave labor the guys who were educated in the American system all of them who went through all of that process of civilization they know what's coming they've been to the Northeast they were educated at schools up in New England they've seen what America's military looks like and they know there's no way they can ever stand up to America and win they've seen the patterns they know what's coming they say Jackson is coming to us now asking to buy our land for 5 million dollars which he did Jackson offered to buy the Cherokee Nation Lock Stock and Barrel for 5 million dollars you guys leave you can have land over in the Oklahoma territory for free we won't even charge you for it but we'll give you 5 million dollars for your land now and they said if we don't take this deal that land is just going to be taken from us completely and we won't get anything to show for now they're not operating within the tribal government this is a cabal a group of people acting on their own but they get together they approach Jackson and say we want to talk about this agreement and concluded a land transaction deal with you on behalf of the Cherokee Nation so they meet and they hold this negotiation and it results in something called the Treaty of new each other the Treaty of Newton is a fraudulent tree let's call it what it is okay it was signed by people to sell land that wasn't Theirs to sell at least they didn't have the legal right to sell it was not done with tribal approval and when the Cherokees here that members of their tribe had gone against the blood laws and sold their land for 5 million dollars and the Jackson now wants them to leave they're in an uproar saying they can't do that they can't speak them behalf of the tribe they were not authorized to do that this treaty is fraudulent Jackson says I see a tree here they are Cherokees right well yes they're okay then I see this as a legitimate treaty and Jackson holds them to it the Cherokees protest and they dig in their heels and say no we are not moving Jackson gives them a time a deadline move by that point or we will move you they call it they think he's bluffing Jackson sends in the army.\u00a0 He starts rounding up the Cherokees putting them in holding until they're ready to escort them out to the Oklahoma territory on the other side of the Mississippi he rounds them up it takes months to do this rounding all up but finally they get them ready to move when they start the movement is part of the problem they start moving the Cherokees in late August the end of summer what's the problem with that they're in Georgia and they're going to move by foot to Oklahoma territory think about how far that is to walk so if they're leaving in late summer what's the problem winter is when they're going to do most of their walking and it's going to be brutal and in fact that's exactly what happened the soldiers try to keep the people marching at an army Pace now keep in mind the people who are in an army are people who are generally younger generally fairly fit but when you're moving an entire population you're dealing with kids you're dealing with mothers with babies you're dealing with old people who maybe don't move so well you're dealing with a whole range of people who are not ready for a movement like that and you're exposing them to the harsh winter elements as they're being moved in the middle of winter facing exposure and all the rest of that and a lot of people die one third of the Cherokees moved on this removal die before they get there 1/3 but that wasn't the worst of it when you read the textbooks they'll say it roughly 1/3 of the nation was lost in the removal they don't tell you what happened the next year do they when they got there they were just dumped no supplies no Provisions nothing this is your half of the land over on the other side of the river if you come back to this side of the Mississippi will kill you bye and then they were they had no things planted in the ground ready to grow they had to eat out some kind of survival they had no shelters they had nothing and so before all of this is over nearly half of the people of the Cherokee Nation die this was brutal what's more is they were just the first of the five tribes the other four are going to suffer a similar fate all five of the Civilized Tribes will be removed and they will be forcibly moved out by the army when the people here about how heavy-handed Jackson and the Army have been there's actually a lot of outrage in America it's one thing to dispossess people and clear up the land but it's another thing to wipe out somewhere between one quarter and one half of them in the process and people say you know I'm all for free and up the land but that was pretty bad on the part of Jackson and some people there of the mindset any good Indian is a dead in you in other words they don't have a problem with it but most people are saying this isn't right the way they're doing it isn't right now I agree that we should free that up so that the land can be utilized to its maximum potential but that doesn't mean slaughtering the Indians in the in the process this is uncivilized and that accusation starts to stick to Jackson and in his particular case it's probably fairly accurate he's not exactly the most civilized guy the massive outcry against the removal that was done for the Five Civilized Tribes forces America to change their policy again so the first policy that we talked about was civilization Indian Removal was this. That was the second big one but they're going to have to shift it to something else and this is where you get reservations now what's up on number one it was an attempt to assimilate people removal is moving down to option two it's clear we're never going to be able to convince them to sell their land like Real Americans therefore we simply have to remove them and take it and we'll put them on the other side of the river separation notice that number four kind of rings in there a little bit too okay reservations they found that the best way to create reservations was instead of moving people from here a long way away to somewhere else it was to instead leave them where they are just cut down the amount of land that they're on so instead of having this much land they then squeeze them down to this much land and that becomes their new reservation that way they don't have to move them from some place to some place they just have to cram them into a smaller piece of land reservation in place but there are still some people who undergo fairly extensive relocation programs as well probably the most extreme example of this was during the Civil War and this one was actually done for military reasons during the Civil War the big strategy of the Union overall was to deny the South goal with gold they can purchase foreign assistance they can purchase weapons and supplies they need a goal and so one thing the union wanted to do was keep the Confederacy away from any gold well a large amount of gold existed somewhere around the Four Corners regions of the US you guys know where that is I see some people we're talking about Utah Colorado Arizona New Mexico the gold that was down there a lot of people are saying well the Navajo Nation is down there in big numbers and they live on land where there's gold so maybe we should remove them out of there just so we can secure that area and make sure the Confederates don't get access to it we don't know which way the Navajo are going to go so why don't we just go in move them out we can secure that make sure that the Confederates don't get access to it if they had asked the Navajo who do you support they were full on for the union they didn't want to support the Confederacy they thought the Confederacy was a bad idea they didn't like what was going on and they were loyal to the US they wouldn't have opened it up for confederate mining but the union acted in a laterally and moved them out 300 mile relocation now it wasn't the time of year that was the problem it was where they relocated them to they moved them from more or less Arizona across New Mexico to settle in Eastern New Mexico in a place called The Boston Redondo the boss Redondo is pretty much the worst area of the United States land wise that you can get to it is horrible Death Valley and take a bit away as far as how attractive you guys know Death Valley yeah the boss Redondo first of all summers getting up around 125 126\u00b0 happens all the time way up into the 120s this is where ultimately we set up one of our nuclear testing sites why because nobody in their right mind wants to live there that's where they were moved to that area Eastern New Mexico is really uninhabitable without outside assistance you can't Farm there the soil has no real nutrients and the nutrients it does have are eliminated because the water coming out of the ground is so heavily alkaline nothing can grow there the alkaline imbalance makes it so any plants that start growing up shrivel and die after they get about this tall the Navajo actively are trying to grow stuff the Army is out there they're going man and when the war is over Union wins the Army commanders in when can we let these guys go home this is not working out here it takes the government three years okay fine let him go home and eventually they say Navajo you can go back to where you came from 300 miles back 300 miles this way 300 miles back through the desert that was a brutal experience but when they got back the one compensation they did get the Navajo got the largest reservation created for any Indian group in the United States it is by far land-wise the largest part of it though is because Arizona has a lot of areas that it's not exactly an easy place to get a lot of production out of the land which is one of the reasons why they were willing to give it to him in the first place because there wasn't a lot of demand for farming settling to get on to that land okay so yeah there will be some attempts along the way to get rid of reservations but by and large all the Indians in America were more or less on reservations by 1890 that was the point where America said okay the United States has fully expanded after the Pacific all the Indians are on reservations they called this the closure of the West this era of Westward Expansion was now over and people started to believe that the Indians were going on to the reservation because it gave them a place to peaceably gradually die out and made from existence they believed Indians were basically endangered species that their time was over and they were fading from existence and that they would one day die out the reservations were essentially made as places where they could do exactly that paid from existence and die out with the understanding that when they died out the reservations would no longer be needed yeah how did that work out do we still have reservations oh yeah they're all over the place Indians Native Americans do they still exist bigger numbers than they had back then so far from dying out they're actually increasing now America because they no longer saw Native Americans in and around all of their daily life as they had for decades had come to the realization here that hey Indians really are Vanishing are they Vanishing no they've been put on these pieces of land and told to stay there that's why not seeing Indians but out of sight out of mind they're able to convince themselves that the Indians are actually fading away the myth of the vanishing Indian is born part of this is due to the separation approach if we don't have to see them maybe they really don't exist you can't see what I'm doing here back behind my my back and they're getting into trouble and they're looking straight at mommy you can't see it Mom's going laughing at the kids doing it well essentially that's what America is doing on a large scale if we don't see them they don't really exist we can convince ourselves that they're fading and one day we'll be right they'll be gone they believe it's part of the natural order the Indians are part of a bygone era of a Savage barbaric world that has being taken over by civilization and as civilization moves forward their way of life is dying out they convinced themselves of that that this is progress in Indians were standing in the way of progress and well some things that happen to them were lamentable ultimately it was inevitable the interesting thing is how the stereotypes will change and evolve over time for example when the rise of Cinema came in the early 20th century he had the motion picture camera the motion picture projector western movies were popular and they frequently had movies where you had like cowboys and Indians Indians were always the bad guys and they never seem to have a reason for being the bad guys they were Savages after all so they didn't really need a reason to be brutal they just were always the Perpetual bad guys all the Indians are coming they're going to slaughter us all the good settlers is that really true first of all if they came after you chances are they had a very very good reason and usually it was because you stole their land from them okay they kind of downplay that part well they don't really have a good reason to be angry with us to go and Slaughter us so that was kind of how it was portrayed yeah yes she's asking about whether they were seen as people or if they were dehumanized the answer isn't quite simple the answer is yes some people dehumanized them and said they're a little more than animals others said no they are real people and we need to save their souls and they will actively try to convert them and give them a good education and missionary schools to teach them not only religion but educate them along the way we're a staple on reservations this became normal where missionary runs schools were the standard okay so you see the cowboy and Indian Motif come out but then all of a sudden you start seeing little cracks come into it for example The Lone Ranger you guys heard of The Lone Ranger a lot of you are going yeah I've heard of him never saw it okay The Lone Ranger had a trusty sidekick what was his name anyone Johnny Depp was in one of the movies although it was horrible no you don't know his sidekick's name was panto a Native American and Tonto was seen as a good Indian he was the guy helping out the Lone Ranger but they're realized the real problem what was the name of the show again The Lone Ranger loan one what's Tonto comic relief isn't it the two Rangers no he doesn't quite get that status funny a scene in a more positive light so that all Indians are bad stereotype is getting softened over time something interesting happens around the 60s and 70s however America is suffering from massive pollution we have Atomic weapons that have been detonated on American soil radiation is seeping in there we have industry polluting the water polluting the air we have cars that have no smog protection and Los Angeles now has a brown Haze hanging over it that is so thick you can taste it get up in the morning and all of a sudden Indians start being portrayed in a way where they're looked at with nostalgia well back in the Indian. Yeah they weren't quite as advanced but you know what they respected their environment they embraced it they took care of it and look what we're doing to it are we really civilized or maybe they were civilized and suddenly they become looked at as this beautiful past that's gone by where things were pure simpler better and they weren't polluting everything and this stereotype is one that really gets embraced I want to show you real quick exactly what I'm talking about one of the most famous ads okay this is now known as The Crying Indian commercial I'm going to give you some exposure to it so you can understand exactly how Native American imagery is being used in this context.

so the West the Midwest the places where farmers were located those areas tended to Ally themselves politically with the southerners and the reason wasn't because they supported slavery but because the South they had a common cause also most of the exports from the Midwest when they ship things overseas they sailed things down the Mississippi River and they went out through the port of New Orleans okay so that meant that they had a close connection with the South and they had economic ties to the South however as the 1840s progress something else is going on railroads railroads are expanding and they're moving into that Midwestern area and people figure out hey the railroads are far faster and more effective for me to get my props to Market and so instead of going out of the Southern Port of New Orleans which is it the base of the Mississippi River as it leaves into development Mexico and as a result of that the political Alliance of the Midwest start shifting away from the south and toward the North and there's a lot of people in the midwest we're saying I opposed slavery but I oppose it simply because I don't want to hear it's not that they are morally objecting to slavery and they're not advocating for slavery to be Outlaw to the contrast they just don't want slavery in their state it's a way to keep slavery out and it's not the slavery they object to it's the people they don't want African Americans in their state they said the reason why the south is having so many problems is because they're too mixed so these people are called free soilers they're people who are against slavery in their area and they don't want that slavery pushed on them meanwhile the south is feeling more and more cornered as the West starts allying with the Northeast on their views on slavery when we talk about political power Congress is split into two houses House of Representatives and the Senate right how's the representative how do you determine who gets in what's it based on how do you determine how many representatives you get what's a based on population size okay the North or the South which one has the higher population and the slaves don't count the North all those immigrants who are coming in the people from Ireland the people from other places are all coming in looking for jobs are there jobs in the south no the slaves are in the workforce Academy they don't need immigrant labor the immigrants are getting drawn to the factories which are up north the industrial North is expanding rapidly and they are getting wealthier and wealthier as they go but more than that they're getting a huge population they are growing by Leaps and Bounds over the South the South knows that in the politics of Washington DC they have absolutely no hope of winning any kind of Southern vote in the House of Representatives which means that they need to stop some kind of unpopular legislation if they need to block it where does that have to happen if it can't happen in the house where does it happen there we go The Senate came in a whole lot faster than anybody expected it to when they may be Louisiana Purchase back in the early 1800s under Thomas Jefferson\u00a0 they had to come up with a rule for whether people came in with their new States out of the Louisiana Territory that they had just acquired whether they would come in as a for your slave state and so what they did is they had decide that when the first one actually entered that was Missouri 1820 they said okay Missouri's here and they want to be a slave state so fine they're a slave state and everything south of the Southern border of Missouri is a slave state when it comes into the union and everything north of that will be a free state that was the agreement they made it was called the Missouri Compromise by the 1850s the problem here is now you're getting territories outside of the\u00a0 Louisiana Territory coming in and the big one that they expected to be a slave state ends up being a free state California Southerners genuinely thought it was going to be a slave state but it wasn't and then they take a look at the rest of the Louisiana Territory and realize everything below that line that they drew has already entered the Union all the slave states that can come from Louisiana Territory have come from the Louisiana Territory but there is still plenty of unoccupied or unincorporated territories that have not yet become States north of that one what's that mean for the South balance in the Senate that they've been maintaining for a long time is suddenly in Jeopardy and if that happens they will be completely at the mercy of the northern voters and if the northern voters go to the extreme of wanting to outlaw slavery there would be nothing the South can do to stop it if that balance gets disrupted so the southerners are feeling like they were pushed back into a corner they can't rely on the west remember the Midwest I said they were politically alive early on but now they're becoming more and more allied with the North so they're becoming a little bit more worried a little more desperate now meanwhile there's a fringe party risen the Republican party and it originally was made by people that were viewed within dominant Americans society as extremists they included people like abolitionists people who were willing to sacrifice themselves even die for the cause of abolition most people thought abolitionists were a little wacky okay they thought they were people way over on the extreme and when his new party starts up the Republican Party nobody gives it a second thought they're not they don't take it seriously the Democratic party has a firm hold on America and the Democratic party is one that support slavery enter the Kansas and Nebraska territories the Kansas and Nebraska territories are within the Louisiana Purchase in Kansas is ready to apply for Statehood and the South now sees their balance going away they know that 90% of the people in Kansas oppose labor they know this this is no secret they know that when Kansas comes in they're going to choose to come in as a free state if you give them the choice nonetheless why don't we leave it up to the people in in all of these territories and understand what they're doing they're getting rid of the Missouri Compromise they're throwing that out and saying when new States come in from that territory and for the rest of the territory out here we let them choose whether they want to be a free state university it's called popular sovereignty so the Missouri Compromise gets thrown out and popular sovereignty comes in the Compromise of 1850 they know Kansas will choose to be a free state but they're hoping that others will choose to be a slave state instead and that's the hope that they're dangling for the southerners meanwhile the South does does not believe for one instant that any any territory up there will come in as a slave state reason being they're all free sweaters they're people who don't want slavery in their territory because they don't want slaves in their territory it's not that they're objecting to the institution they're objecting to it in their backyard so they will choose freedom so essentially Kansas will be a referendum on slavery that's how the South sees it that if they choose to come in as a free state slavery is now in Jeopardy and the North and run roughshod over all Southern interests they've been able to keep the balance for a while but now it's in danger and so things start getting heated as Kansas is getting ready to choose in their election between whether they're going to be a slave statement free state there's violence there's harassment there's all sorts of tactics keep free state voters away from the polls But ultimately what happens is a whole huge number of people from Missouri come flooding over the border into Kansas to vote in their election when they finally did Tally's later they found that 2/3 of the votes that were cast were fraudulent 65% of them yikes that is by far the most corrupt election in American history that is voter fraud on an epic scale and when that happens all hell breaks loose Kansas turns into a Battleground in response to this vote where all of a sudden people are saying oh yes the pro slavery group won the voting Kansas yeah sure they did they said all those people from Missouri you came in and voted they did it so that they can force slavery honest Ram it down our throat now keep in mind with the Republican party is safe the South will ultimately try to force slavery on the rest of the country by any means necessary now most people are saying oh yeah that's that's hogwash but the Republicans are saying No this is slave power they are pushing slave power you watch they're going to do this and everybody's discounting the Republicans they're out on the out on the edge and and they're just extremists well Kansas changes a lot of people's opinions all of a sudden this massive voter fraud on an epic scale starts getting people to say were the Republicans right?\u00a0 Are they trying to impose slave Park cuz this sure looks like they're trying to subvert the will of the voters and force slavery on Kansas and then violence breaks out in cans Kansas has its own little Civil War one night a man named John Brown who is an abolitionist staunch opponent to slavery and he hears about all the voter fraud that went on in Kansas and he is in Kansas he hates it he rises up one night with his sons and they all take up broadswords you know like knights from the Middle Ages and they invade three different families homes and all three of them were pro-slavery people and they kill them all with the swords and that starts a wave of violence in both directions the South will form a drunken Army and they actually get their hands on two cannons they invade Lawrence Kansas and they expect to find people there but people tipped off Lawrence Kansas hey this big mob of people is coming so they find the town is deserted basically but the violence will continue to escalate back in Washington news gets back to the Senators and Congressman of what's going on and one of the most outspoken Advocates of getting rid of slavery one of the biggest components of slavery is Senator Charles Sumner and Senator Sumner delivers a scathing speech in front of a joint house and the Senate are present for this and the speech was entitled the crime against Kansas Picture of everything that happened he puts the blame fully on the senior senator from the state of South Carolina Senator Andrew Butler saying he's the reason they're doing this the sovereignty of. he's encouraging this kind of illegal Behavior he in. And Senator Senator Butler wasn't present to rebut this howeverhis brother-in-law a congressman from South Carolina Preston Brooks was and after after Summoners done with his speech he's pulling together all of his notes at the lectern and Preston Brooks walks down to the floor of the room where all the speeches were being given and proceeds to beat Senator Sumner unconscious with his walking stick\u00a0 on the senate floor the first time it's ever happened people start going you know what maybe the Republicans got the right view of this and maybe I'm wrong\u00a0 maybe I should listen to him a bit more and then the Supreme Court got into the action the Dred Scott case was heard Scotty Sanford you guys know about the Dred Scott face\u00a0 sort of okay drink Scott was a slave who had been taken with his master to visit friends up north in Minnesota and then they returned back to the South and Dred Scott filed charges saying I should have gotten freed when I crossed over into free territory now the laws of America were very clear that when you crossed the line North you don't automatically game you're free there were slave runaways who were being caught and returned to their owners below that line so the fugitive slave laws alone would have been enough to debunk this that's all the more that should have happened in this court case instead chief justice Rodger Taney who is a southerner wants to give judicial protection for slavery and he oversteps and he oversteps in a big way and in the process he writes what is arguably the worst Supreme Court decision ever in his history certainly the top three and that is he says that not only is he a Slave but all the laws in the north that that outlaw slavery or unconstitutional because the Constitution says slavery is legal which it doesn't and he uses a lot of questionable rationale but basically says Congress does not possess the right to outlaw slavery or regulate it and limited in any territory in the United States in other words what was the Republicans are saying it's going on the south is trying to Ram slavery down everybody's throat here's Roger Taney trying to do exactly that so rather than take a more conciliatory approach and try to work out the deal in a calmer or sedate way the south is lashing out and they're doing it in very unethical ways\u00a0 so after the dreads got decision comes down a lot of people in the north are saying you know I don't want to destroy the South and I don't want to outlaw slavery but this is going too far the Republicans got it right the south is trying to force slavery on everyone and I don't want slavery up here there's people who want slavery outlawed for their own beliefs that slavery is wrong but there's also people who want slavery limited just because they don't want to be inundated with them and then John Brown is heard from again John Brown and a number of followers take a trip out to Harpers Ferry Virginia where they overrun a federal Armory a federal Armory that's where the military keeps his weapons okay so he's trying to steal military grade weaponry and he wants to use those weapons to arm a slave rebellion problem is he tried to do it in Virginia remember what I said about how the upper South where the tobacco is being grown depleted their soil and they started to sell off most of their slaves to the Deep South there weren't enough slaves in Virginia to really do this convincingly and brown didn't really get that and so there he is holding Harpers Ferry taking control of it and he had nobody to give weapons too and was surrounded he was caught he and others were put on trial and he was executed in 59 now the southern response to this is oh well that guy was clearly a nut job in a criminal he was terrorists I mean he over he overran a federal Armory and tried to start a flavorful when Southerners have nightmares they see armed slaves killing them and sitting their throat when they shut their eyes worst nightmare and they see somebody who actually tried to make that nightmare come true so of course they're saying well clearly this guy was an insane Criminal it's a good thing they executed and across the North Church bells are ringing where churches are saying he was actually a martyr for the cause he laid down his life in the in pursuit of freeing the slaves because it was immoral they're going I can't believe they're actually not only condoning this guy but celebrating this guy was a criminal and they realized just how wide that division is now keep in mind this is only about a year and a half before the start of the Civil War so the tensions are really ramping up and then came the election of Abraham Lincoln was running on the Republican ticket this party had suddenly become a real player but the whole thing is the Democrats were still a big enough party to wear they had a 60% majority there's no way Lincoln could have won until the Democrats did something incredibly stupid the southern delegation came into the Democratic National convention we want to run on a platform of slave power nationalized Slave Code and the northern Democrats are saying we can't do that there's no way we get elected if we do that now why don't we just stick to popular sovereignty and take the moderate room and the southern delegation refuses and the northern delegation refuses to go along with the southerners and ultimately they form separate conventions\u00a0 the southern delegation of Democrats won one candidate the northern delegation run another one and guess what they do they split the vote right down the middle\u00a0 30% in the north 30% of the Sout. 40% for Lincoln Lincoln won with 40% of the national vote no president in history ever before or since has ever won with that little of the national book 40%, and the South suddenly was scared out of their winds oh my gosh we put a republican in the presidency he is going to use all sorts of presidential incentives to induce the western states that come in to be free states he's going to try to put in a system where slavery is outlawed maybe even a constitutional amendment that Outlaws and before Lincoln ever sets foot in office December of 1860 a month after the election matter of fact it was I remember right December 23rd just before Christmas day anyway it's right around that Christmas. Of time South Carolina secedes they pull out of the Union they don't even wait to see what Lincoln might do or what they might be able to achieve under Lincoln they don't take the chance they just break off right there and a couple others will follow him others are more hesitant they want to see what happens and ultimately it will slide into a Civil War by April 61 Laura's butt Northwinds the south is now a defeated enemy okay when the north winds keep in mind that the South pulled out of the United States but when they lose the idea is they are going to be brought in gradually but they're not in control of the government until they come back in which means the north controls Congress both houses and they control the presidency as long as Lincoln is in Lincoln gets shot and a Democrat will actually become president Johnson but and they will start imposing their will on the south the first is the 13th Amendment 13th Amendment is very simple slavery is illegal it is a ban on slavery in the United States so 13th Amendment officially wipes out slavery when that happens the southern states will start passing local laws that start putting restrictions on the recently freed blacks by saying well let's come up with a series of laws that essentially keep them in a state of forced labor without calling its labor so it was de facto slavery and in order to counter that Congress starts passing laws that the South just ignores at which point another Constitutional Amendment will be passed one that horses the state laws to abide by the national law essentially saying National laws higher than the state laws and they have to agree or the state laws are overturned there was this concept of States had individual sovereignty over their local laws and if the conflict came between the national law and the local law on a local issue local law was the one that went they went with and essentially the 14th Amendment will change that keep in mind people of all the amendments ever put into the Constitution the 14th is quite possibly the most significant and the reason is because it forces all the rest of those laws that the government will pass at the federal level to apply to the state so every time you see a constitutional challenge of a law a state law that never would have happened before the 14th Amendment after the 14th Amendment so if they're ever challenging the constitutionality of a state law in the US or in the US Supreme Court well guess what the 14th Amendment will always be used as a rationale at least in part issue on Free Speech they'll cite the First Amendment and they'll say the 14th Amendment making the First Amendment apply to the state you see how much teeth that has suddenly the South no longer has the ability to do all this without violating federal law the one Saving Grace for the South the Supreme Court is dominated by Southerners keep that in mind then they go one more step as more and more restrictions try to get put on put in place on blacks in the South recently freed slaves they sink the nail in the car the 15th amendment gives black men the right to vote participate civically and run for office they can become congressman they can become Senators they can run for president if they want and they can vote voting is political power the 15th amendment was controversial in a lot of ways where the big controversy came was not actually in giving black men the right to vote they expected that something like this would be full but they thought that maybe it would be universal suffrage the the controversial thing was the exclusion of women white women had been pushing for quite a while hey why don't you give us the right to vote and then they hear the 15th Amendment is coming down and they think they have a shot at convincing people to include women in that and then they find that they're including black men but they're not including white women remember the great chain of being white women saw themselves above everyone of other races and now they feel like they've just been dropped down below them so this is a big blow to the white women leading the charge was Elizabeth Cady Stanton and she ultimately becomes the founder of the women's suffrageman she will be joined later by Susan B Anthony and together they will fight for over half a half of half a century I almost said half a decade and then I almost said half a millennium 50 years.\u00a0\u00a0 Taking all of those Southern States and bringing them back into the United States piece by piece reconstructing the Union they want to bring everybody back in when the blacks come in for the vote for the first time. See black exercising the right to vote interesting thing take a look at the difference variety this was actually a well-constructed artistic piece by Thomas Nast the political cartoonist fairly poor he was a former slave probably a long time given gray hair Gray beard and he's voting behind him this guy's actually fairly well dressed isn't he </p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%204/1460%20Feb%2015/#blacks-voting-for-the-first-time-in-the-us","title":"blacks voting for the first time in the US","text":"<p>so it's showing you that some free blacks are actually doing okay financially usually from the north and usually with their freedom papers before the war behind him a union veteran a soldier somebody who served during the Civil War on the side of the north and he's voted so this gives you a little bit of a cross-section as some of the people who are involved and the fact that it's not just all field hands voted there's a widespread of people okay and what the south is afraid of is coming to pass blacks are getting political power the only way to fight this is to keep them away from the poles so they start using intimidation and Terror attacks and to that end an organization forms on an X by an X Confederate kernel whose name was Nathan Bedford Florence and he organizes a bunch of local people most of them are veterans of the Confederacy and they were part of the losing side they didn't like losing and they don't like the future of what's coming the organization they form is a loose organization it's not well organized it's more or less people who want to Simply intimidate people from voting that's their job that's what they want to do they call themselves now here's another political cartoon by Thomas Nast </p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%204/1460%20Feb%2015/#1st-ku-klux-klan","title":"1st Ku Klux Klan","text":"<p>showing you what the clan is standing for okay over here on the left who is this guy okay he's an ex confederate soldier notice and he's shaking hands with the clan who has a big smile on his face the clan guy does because he's offering this guy hope he's offering him a direction for his feelings notice that this guy is part of an organization called the white League this was a group that formed after the Civil War of whites across the South were afraid that the white majority would be threatened and they wanted to ensure that whites would remain Superior in the South even after the fall of slavery the blacks would always be below that's what white supremacy means okay yes basically nothing the areas are more or less an extension of the same mindset okay so here you have a guy the white League was that white supremacist organization one of the earliest in the post Civil War. Now take a look at some of the things that are included in this I know that from where you are you may not be able to read all of this up here it says the Union as it was this is a white man's government the United States was made for whites the Lost Cause which was the Civil War the Confederacy they lost and they're they're demoralized they're bummed out their economy is destroyed their food supply is destroyed and now they're freeing the slaves so their society is being destroyed everything about their way of life is completely up in it they don't know what's going to happen next and now black people are voting. Danger warning worse than slavery what is it that they see is worse than slavery a black family man woman baby what are they doing I mean aside from powering in fear Theyre learning. remember one of the biggest dangers people were warned about is literacy don't let black be educated and they see blacks getting educated as being the future danger now keep in mind the clan has an idea that they will try to pass some kind of learning exam in order for people to have to be able to vote so keeping them illiterate means it keeps them out of the polls.\u00a0 None other than war hero Ulysses S Grant for president. And Grant was largely responsible for the strategy that defeated the South that is he's going to deny the South access to any kind of real money. They can't buy weapons they can't buy support from Europe if they don't have money what is their source of money? Cotton. So he comes up with a very simple solution as he's ranging across the South with his army he torches every cotton field he finds. His underling who eventually replaces him when he becomes commander of the entirety of the Union Army is General Sherman and General Sherman not only takes this strategy he upset he takes a whole bunch of EX slaves and he puts them in Union uniforms sort of but they have no military training he calls him Contraband soldiers and essentially when he moves into a new southern town they torch the fields and then he turns the Contraband soldiers out and turns of loose on the homes and says GoNoodle what are they they're terrorizing those people but they don't just stop at destroying the cotton they're also destroying food fields.\u00a0 So the south is dealing with food shortages Too Atlanta has food riots during the later days of the Civil War this is ugly and so people associate all of these things with Grant.\" this is the worst thing that Southerners could have happen other than freeing the slaves\" putting Ulysses S Grant in charge of the country so the KKK is formed To try to defeat his election to keep blacks away from the polls Grant who is still leader of the army at this point sends in troops. Rounds up the clan now keep in mind the clan that you might Envision in your mind is not the first Clan there were three Clans total over history we are now dealing with the third planet they're the ones who are around today the first plan however was only a few hundred people maybe 350 at the most. Okay and they weren't really all that well organized rounds up the vast majority of them and holds them there until after the election results the black feels safer to go to the polls and then very few of them actually get charged with any crimes maybe 20 or 30 and the rest of them are simply let go. Grant was elected 500,000 African Americans voted in that presidential election Grant was elected by a mere 300,000 margin of votes.\u00a0 Grant was elected by the freed slaves they made the difference. And he knew he needed to protect that. If you wanted to get reelected in another 4 years he would have to ensure that they stayed safe and protected. In the Reconstruction period, they moved into a. Called the Freedmen's Bureau. Where the Friedman's Bureau oversaw the protection of Rights of blacks in the south and it would help them with education it would help them in case people were hassling them terrorizing them whatever and backing them up our Union troops Union troops occupied the south after the Civil War they did not leave and so the troops are enforcing this protection the southerners really hate this but even more than that the north was sending down a bunch of people to oversee all of the operations going on in the Deep South okay and these people these officials coming down from the north were supposed to oversee not only protecting the rights of African Americans but also the funding efforts to rebuild the communities that had been destroyed to help people with tangible needs that they have food housing clothes Etc and the problem here is that a lot of those Northern officials were corrupt and they were pocketing a lot of the money and Grant didn't care he didn't do a thing about it those people became known as Carpetbaggers by the south feeling all the money that is meant to help the South and pocketing it for the for himself now are there officials coming down from the north who are legitimately honest absolutely. But are there enough corrupt ones to give this accusation round yes there's a lot of it. This is what the clan thinks about carpet backers *** image 2*** notice this guy is holding a suitcase with Ohio on the side it's telling you he's from the north and this is a carpet bag okay that's that's what they're calling it's a donkey okay with KKK on the side what is that tell you what's a donkey assemble up the KKK supports they are the political Defenders of Democrats\u00a0 not Republican okay so this period Of reconstruction moves into the 1870s the war ended in 1865 and as you move into the 1870s America has a big economic downturn about 73 and when that happens Northerners who are getting really tired of the South resisting everything complaining about everything constantly bringing in issues of everything this wrong with reconstruction you're tired of it you're tired of fighting with them they're tired of all of this crap that's going on they just wanted to go away they say we have other problems to worry about the economy needs to be dealt with reconstructions getting to be a pain so Along Comes the 1875 when the South starts deliberately excluding blacks from their businesses they put limitations on what they can do what they start doing is separating the black community from the white community and making it so the black can't have any interaction with the whites the federal government says okay we got to pass some laws that limit the money so they pass the Civil Rights activity 75 it goes to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court which is largely dominated by seven strikes down almost all the provisions as being unconstitutional saying they violate the Commerce club that people who run businesses have a right to run the Business Without government interfere and the only thing that they say stands are any of the things connected specifically with electioneering basically politics they're allowed to vote they're allowed to run for office that's very clear about a 15th amendment so those Provisions stand but everything else get struck down suddenly people are saying does that mean that this is the new way? This separation of blacks and whites and so more of it starts happening it starts increasing in Pace there's a number of other cases that go back and forth but they're still dealing with that gray area what's the standard? Meanwhile the north is tired of dealing with the south on this whole issue and they just want reconstruction done with 1876 the presidential election there is a lot of voter fraud and the southern candidate wins as the Northerners start to get ready to screen bloody murder of the Southern leaders of the political party the Democrat leaders go let's talk come over here we'll see that there was a certain amount of unethical illegal election going on and we will stand behind you and say yes the northern candidate did in fact win but you got to do something for us. When that candidate gets into office reconstruction is over done. Pull the troops out of the South and let us get on with our lives at which point. The republicans were already done anyways.\u00a0 Hayes takes office and the first thing he does is he says congratulations reconstruction is over we are one nation complete again the United States moves forward from this point on so, reconstruction's over and now all of those troops start pulling out of the South the Freedmen's Bureau goes away, and blacks across the South are kind of goin \"uh oh\" now do the abuses kick in readily any more than they already are? The truth is they didn't and the reason is because Southerners were so happy to see the troops go that they knew if they started really going after African Americans beating him down killing them whatever the troops would come right back in the Northerners would say no no you guys we didn't say you could do that and they'll come back in. Instead the expand on the idea of separating segregation becomes where they focus their attention and it gets some legal challenges all through the 1880s as we move into the 1890s until finally the Supreme Court comes down with a landmark decision Plessy vs Ferguson you guys heard of it some people are going now other people are not.\u00a0 Separate but equal they've come up with a new standard for segregation separate but equal that is it is perfectly constitutional perfectly legal to have separate facilities so long as they're equal. now they get the seperate part very well, but not the equal part. the period That we are moving into the post-blessing period Becomes known as the Jim Crow. Segregation Jim Crow and segregation are interchangeable terms basically the Jim Crow. Starts deliberately creating segregation as policy and putting it into law all across the South segregation is going in segregation of Transportation a white car and a black car or they would call it a colored car\u00a0 blacks had to buy food in the main dining room of a lot of restaurants they had to come around the back and order from the kitchen through the back door they could order food they just couldn't have it in the in the dining room is that separate but equal they don't have a dining room to eat it if they had their own dining room yeah maybe but as it is separate was never equal in fact even when they had equal facilities was it really equal you were trading somebody different lesser less appealing based on the color of their skin based on their race and that was inherent in segregation they're segregating because they don't want those people who are seen as less desirable by the people who are pushing these policies that's where segregation come from and it will last all the way until 1954 when the Supreme Court will take it down until then segregation will be the law of the South the Jim Crow. Immediately starts putting restrictions on voting. But they do it in a way that they say is is not directed at any race it's instead directed at all the people it doesn't exclude anybody based on race and this is the only way they got away with it.\u00a0 A big popular way to limit black from the polls was literacy tests now the white literacy test red like a sea Spot Run book you know those back from your kindergarten or first grade those little learning pamphlets these Spot Run you know those things well that would be kind of what the white test look like the black test red like a PhD dissertation and if you got so much as one word wrong they say nope sorry you don't have the right to vote the Australian ballot became another way in Australia they had a problem with mob corruption where people would follow people into the voting booth and make sure that they voted the way they were supposed to vote either the way they were the only person who's allowed in the voting booth is the person voting that became known as the Australian ballot and so the US said or the southern states brother said well we're simply trying to prevent any time of voter manipulation by ensuring that those people have the right to vote is that really what they're doing no there's some blacks who don't have the reading skills or might miss some of the tricks that lights are using on the ballots and they'll end up voting for the wrong thing well that was another problem there was one ballot for blacks and one ballot for whites develop for whites was very clear-cut about it for blacks it was confusing it was designed to be to trick people into voting for the wrong thing and they didn't have somebody smart looking over their shoulders actually want to do see how that one's kind of Shifting down over here you want to vote for this one you don't have that protection with the Australian ballot gerrymander was another problem redrawing the district lines of where voters are let's say you have a white Community here and a black community next to it and the voting districts originally have this area as one voting district in this area as one voting district well that would mean that the black voting district would have a majority and they'd be able to get their people in in office so what they do is they redraw the lines and instead go this way and this way and say everybody in this group is in one voting district everybody in this group is in another one and in this one they ensure that there's like a 52-48% favor for whites and the same in the other one and so instead of having the blacks win one and the whites win one the whites win them both because they outnumber the blacks in each of those districts because of the way they drew the voting line. That also becomes the way of controlling and limiting black votes.\u00a0 there are two leaders. On the left is Booker T Washington he is America's first PhD and he established the very first college that admitted blacks he wanted to create a university that was their specifically to educate last because they were being discriminated against in so many places and he set a good example for what recently freed African Americans and people in that post Civil War South shoot his fire to that is self-improvement through education that's what he was advocating </p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%204/1460%20Feb%2015/#booker-image","title":"booker image","text":"<p>he is also a significant head he wasn't the first PhD like he was but he was a PhD and he was one of the early so they both have a very high commitment to education were they differ is on their approach to segregation Booker T Washington says don't worry about the segregation laws don't worry about any of that instead focus on what you can control self improvement worry about yourself and when enough people have really improved themselves in our college educated and well spoken Etc they will be able to get those laws changed down the road don't worry about it just deal with what you can focus on WEB Dubois however while he supported all of the educational aspirations he disagreed with Booker T Washington in this he says no too many people have fought and bled and died in order to put these freedoms in place and he's not going to stand by and let those be taken from us gradually piece by piece his big cause is voting rights this is what he's known for. defending black people. But these become two of the most prominent African American voices in how to deal with segregation put up with it for now focus on what you can fight it tooth and nail and especially defend the right but both of them say education good. get educated. Okay so that's something they have in common.\u00a0 And keep in mind at the heart of it is this thing back to the great chain of being the issue of place keeping people in their place places them okay Southerners believe the plastic gotten out of their place so they are deliberately trying to keep them in their place with these segregation laws below whites and every time somebody rises above that they have a word for that \"uppity\". Somebody is rising too far up they call him uppity and they will do everything they can to hammer the nail down whether it's abuse terrorism lynching you name it that is typically how they respond to it self a number of the stereotypes crystallize in this reconstruction and post Reconstruction Era as we move into Jim Crow stereotypes view African Americans as unintelligent and even animalistic oftentimes you'll see political cartoon where blacks are portrayed with faces that look almost like monkeys they look very apee like whites believe it is their Duty to protect the South as well as the North from the ravaging and the excesses of the black community. You know a lot of that early Disney stuff was coming out in the 30s and 40s and segregation is still very much alive and well that was during the Jim Crow Era so yeah you do get some of that going into the Disney films another thing that they portrayed African Americans in general as having no impulse control they aren't able to control their urges if they want booze they start drinking and they can't stop until they're drunk and pass out if they want sex they can't stop themselves if they want somebody with sex especially black men they will go after them until they get them and what is it that every black man wants more than anything else in the world white women yes that becomes part of The Stereotype and all of those stereotypes are portrayed big screen on the first Epic full length motion picture ever made in history. The movie was an absolute Masterpiece in cinematography they pioneered all sorts of movie making techniques that are still used today it was brilliant it is also arguably the most racist movie ever made and it was called The Birth of a Nation none of you you have or pieces of it at least yeah it was 3 hours long it was epic no movie had ever even approached this DW Griffith was a southerner but he also wholeheartedly believe the stereotypes were real and basically this movie was about the rise of the Ku Klux Klan as Heroes not just Defenders of the Southern cause but Defenders of the misguided Northerners who misjudged the African Americans and were being victimized by them and they had to come to their aid too so this isn't a stubborn thing it's a white versus black thing it's not a regional thing it's a national thing and heroizes the clan in such a way that it inspires the researchers rise because of this movie when you think of the clan images of the clan like this Burning crosses white sheets pointy heads eye holes cut out that's the second Clan that's where this was done widespread the big armies of people well this is during World War 1 that Birth of a Nation came out 1915 by the end of the war there's black veterans returning home and they saw what life was over like in Europe they said \"boy things are so much better for us over there\". And all of a sudden you start seeing a string widespread a widespread occurrence of lynchings going on across the South where a lot of returning black veterans from World War 1 religion in their uniforms </p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%204/1460%20Feb%2015/#2nd-kkk-image","title":"2nd KKK image","text":"<p>also going on during this time is the social reform of the Progressive Era we'll talk about that when we get to the religious section 2 but a lot of Reform is going on at this point in time and one of the big reforms was anti-alcohol also\u00a0 widespread immigration is coming in and a lot of people are becoming very very nativist in their mindset remember nativism anti-immigrant and then there's the Protestants they aren't just anti-alcohol they are anti-catholicand this is where the second plan is genius being Diversified they're not just saying it's about African Americans they're saying it's about America for Americans in other words they embrace the religious Protestant approach of wanting to fight the Catholic influence wanting to fight the Immigrant influence wanting to fight the black influence and keep America American there's a lot of people say well I don't really agree with their tape on African Americans but you know what they say about those Catholics? \"mmmhmm\".\u00a0 And all of a sudden they get support from that group well I don't really care about the Catholics but boy I sure care about all those immigrants coming in \"mmmhmm\" and they draw support from that the plan diversifies they learn some lessons from this. Of time one of the big things that happens is the rise of the mega Corporation the trusts Rockefeller Carnegie people like this and they use that same organization for the clan to give them widespread organization Across the Nation and they also come up with interesting names which are kind of absurd in today's time for example the local leader of the local chapters of the KKK we're called kleagals. And you ever see one of those plan guys that's wearing the red outfit not the white outfits everybody else is wearing that guy's a grand wizard he's sort of like a regional area director like a regional vice president. Notice how it's mirroring the corporations and then you have the National High Grand wizard who organizes everything National. So they have structure they have memberships they have people who are in charge of things they do organizational activities both terrorist activities as well as Community Support activities to give them a positive view.

That segregation starts being challenged as an idea part of it was that during World War II we had segregated troops and the idea there was that well the soldiers will feel better being with their own kind but the implication was the white units or the elite ones in the color units are the ones that are sort of the B team compared and that was kind of the unspoken perception within the military however some groups are going to come along that really challenge those ideas and bring the Forefront the way many of the different segregated units are truly excelling and becoming the class of the military one group that was formed during the war that wanted to challenge some of the assumptions and norms was a group called the 99% Squadron more commonly they are known as the\u00a0</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%205/1460%20Feb%2022/#tuskegee-airmen","title":"Tuskegee Airmen","text":"<p>African Americans were banned from flying war planes.

While they're being used for dive bomb. How many air enemies are they getting countering in North Africa? Not many. So basically the leaders of not just the 99 but the growing group of aviators being trained starts protesting hey give us a real job you want to see how we fight in combat don't keep us behind the lines hitting ground targets give us something real and so they did. In Europe, the Air corps has been bombing Germany and they had been doing so a great expense on avg most of the bomb runs resulted in a 30% loss of airships in other words one out of three does not come home every time they go up those are ugly numbers and you know it's bad enough having one mission where you lose a third of your bombers but every time they go up and they said what's going on well the commander of the new Air Group which combines several squadrons they became the 332nd Air Group figured it out he said the white Pilots have been told when you encountered German planes go after him and shoot him down but what's happening is the Germans are pulling them off and then another group of Germans will come in from the other side and attack the planes without opposition and that's how they were losing their planes so he said the whites won't change the way they're fighting we will we stick with the bombers and if the Germans want to turn tail and run let them if they come back hit him again. Stick with the bombers like you're tied with the string. And they start doing this and lo and behold once the tusky year men take over bomber defence they don't lose a single bomber to enemy action not one the white units were losing 1/3 they didn't lose any. Their approach affected the rest of the airport and how the rest of the pilots will defend the bombers because of their overwhelming success there are other groups who are distinguishing themselves as well. Arguably the greatest tank commander to come out of World War II and probably the greatest in history with the possible exception of Rommel was George Patton. General Patton was famous especially for a tank maneuver that he did during the Battle of the Bulge which is really the largest battle in the history of the world. Huge numbers of people over a million people were engaged in that battle it was big. And ultimately he ended up taking his Armored Division through a raging blizzard the worst one they had seen in years. 24 straight hours for the first pet everybody thought that they'd stop after that he doesn't he keeps them going for 48 straight hours constantly in combat in the middle of this blizzard any stages of breakthrough in the German lines in doing so one particular tank group within his division a tank Battalion called the 761st tank Battalion otherwise known as the Black Panthers was it the spearhead of this. And he says hey people can complain all they want give me all the color boys you can I love them. These guys know how to fight. And they are excelling the Black Panthers kill more and lose less than any other tank Battalion under any Commander's command at that point. That's how effective they were. These guys were great. Now another interesting thing is a side note that comes out of that. one of the officers within the 761st tank battalion was a man named John Robinson otherwise known as Jackie Robinson</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%205/1460%20Feb%2022/#john-jackie-robinson","title":"John \"Jackie\" Robinson","text":"<p>after the war is over he goes back to his original career baseball and he is so good that he becomes the first African American signed to a major league baseball team to play in a game he signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers and he basically was the best player in baseball or it certainly top three Jackie Robinson will break the color line in Major League Baseball others are breaking the color line in other ways but one thing is constant throughout this: segregation is starting to Chip Away. Another group that was significant was the 442 regimental combat team who were they? Japanese Americans. While their families were being interned in camps back in the United States they were saying hey America's my country too and I'm wanting to fight for it and a whole bunch of other Japanese with them for saying we do too and so they formed a Japanese group and they sent them to Germany that group was the most heavily decorated group in the entire us command more Medals of Honor were given to the Japanese 442nd than any other unit in the United States. That's how good they were. And then there comes the first real desegregation that you see and it was out of necessity. the Marines down in the South Pacific, as they were fighting the Japanese, had a problem and the problem was the Japanese had broken all of their Battlefield codes which meant they didn't have secure Communications on the battlefield. As a result as soon as the Americans send out a message oh we're going to do this the Japanese are listening to it knowing exactly what they're going to do and they are able to shift their fire. The Marines were taking huge losses because of this. and so they say well we need to come up with a better code so who did they turn to? Native Americans.</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%205/1460%20Feb%2022/#navajo-code-talker","title":"Navajo Code-Talker","text":"<p>Specifically the DNA people otherwise known as the Navajo they turn to people who could speak native Navajo language as well as English both fluently that was key you had to be able to speak both of them and they used the language to create a code and in order for it to work there had to be a Navajo code talker put with every single unit so that they can communicate securely now when these guys first show up the white units are going oh man you got to be kidding. We're the ones who get the racial policies we're the ones are getting desegregated. And they resented them. That ended after the very first battle. The first battle they saw just how many people these guys were saving. And as a result not only will they not protest them anymore they will fight to protect them. They will do everything in their power to protect them because they know that these guys are keeping them alive. Overwhelmingly successful the Japanese never broke that code they said it's kind of like listening to someone speak in a foreign language backwards underwater. They could not make sense of it it was bizarre to them they couldn't they spent tons of time trying to break that communication they couldn't do it. When the war ends the success of a desegregated unit,... Is used for the war effort something they take pride in and other place you know other groups within World War II are being overwhelmingly successful proving that minorities not only are not inferior but in some cases they're actually performing at far better levels than any of the white units were so this is starting to change people's mindset \"oh they're not as good they're not the B Team\" they're the 18 and that's the realization a lot of people are coming to. also,\u00a0 the African American units especially but really all people who were non-white in uniform, when they went over to Europe the people in Europe did not treat them as black Americans Japanese Americans, they treated them as Americans. everybody was treated the same based on the uniform this is something they had in common with World War I but the numbers were vastly bigger in this war than they were World War I. World War I had a relatively smaller amount of people involved but World War II was very different. We had huge numbers of people in that war and when they come back they come back with pride charity and a little bit more of a global perspective on race and so all of this is setting the stage for a challenge of segregation. They don't have to wait long. 1947 two years after the end of World War II an interesting case Rises up in the federal court system in California specifically. A segregation case. Remember that California segregated People based on language but really this was a smokescreen they really were segregating people of Mexican ancestry away from white students and keeping that that separation and they said it was based on the language they spoke but in this case the court case Mendez V Westminster the Mendez family sent their kids to school but they don't speak Spanish they speak English and they're being excluded from English speaking schools and that was the basis of their fight said hey they're saying we're being segregated based on our language. Doesn't apply here. And yet our kids are still being forced to go to the Spanish-speaking schools. At which point it goes up through the courts up to the Appellate level. now for those of you not familiar with the federal courts and I'm assuming most of you probably aren't the federal court system is on three levels the district level these are the local courts above them is the Appellate level otherwise known as the circuit courts and then at the top the Supreme Court. Now here's how Federal jurisprudence Works in other words court cases that go through the system if a court case is decided at the district level that ruling only applies to the district that they're in. now that doesn't mean other districts can't look at that and use it as a reason for deciding things the same way. often they do but it's only binding in the district that that opinion is given however it gets appealed and it goes up to the Circuit level and once up to the Circuit level, there are three circuits in the United States. Okay? The circuit opinion applies to all the districts within their circuit but it doesn't apply to the other two. In order for it to apply to everyone it goes up to the Supreme Court. This case only went up to the Circuit Court. And the people who did not like the ruling nonetheless were afraid of trying to appeal up to the Supreme Court. And the reason they were afraid is it was a segregation case. They didn't want to automatically have it apply to other circuits and here's the problem. This circuit was West Coast. It was not the same circuit as the Deep South. if it went up to the supreme court, it could be spread out to everyone. It was done in California. And in California the governor of California his name was Earl Warren, he did not like segregation. he didn't like the segregated schools but he didn't have the political clout and the people on his side in order to get rid of it. So, when Mendez is handed down and the court case Appeals and doesn't make Supreme Court it applies to the Circuit he says well it's clear that it's gone through the circuit it's not going up to the Supreme Court so this is law California is desegregating nothing I can do about it bye and he instantly he desegregates no resistance at all he wanted that case to stand. I mentioned him because he becomes important very soon. So this case came down in 47. Around this time Jackie Robinson also joins the Dodgers in 47. The cracks in the dams are starting and it's getting ready to break. And we being the voice the head of the end of the ACT smells blood in the water he says now's our time. We've got to go after segregation hard now we're primed and ready for it. But in order to do that effectively he needed the right guy at the helm. He needed a shark of a lawyer he needed somebody who is brilliant somebody who is gifted and he found it. The man's name was Thurgood Marshall. T. Marshall is very significant in a lot of ways one thing he's significant in he has argued more court cases in front of the Supreme Court than any other lawyer in history: 32. And he's won more than anybody else has 29. 29 out of 32 cases that he argued he won that is one amazing success rate and it's testimony just how good he was also he will go on to become the first African American to sit on the Supreme Court he will be appointed in 1967 so clearly he is destined for big things. now when Thurgood Marshall is brought in, he looks at things and how they're going down he says okay. This Mendez case that was argued out there in the West Coast. This is given us a road map. Education is the key we need to focus on education that's how we beat segregation and he says let's hit the Supreme Court where it hurts. Where every one of them can relate. A law school case. That's what they're looking for and they find it. In 1950 a case Rises up to the Supreme Court that Marshall champions: sweatt bee painter sweaters s w e a t t sweat. Herman was a very gifted student who applied to law school at the University of Texas and the University of Texas law school sent him a reply saying\u00a0 \"sorry we don't accept colored students at the University of Texas law school\" this was a law school you think they'd be smarter than that. A lot of the lawyers in the school suddenly said you said what to him no no send back a letter change that you got it you got to fix this this is violation of blessing we will get hammered for this send back another letter correcting it and so the University of Texas sends out a new list saying sorry the previous letter that you received was an error congratulations you are now admitted to the University of Texas School of Law. And now they're going okay great now we have one black student how are we going to come up with a separate but equal program to educate him? Okay now at this point, I want to clarify something. All law schools are not created equal. and all lawyers know this. Define them by tier Tier 1 schools are the ones at the top tier 2 very good schools. So tier one is like the top 25 tier two 26 to 50 and they continue down here three to four to five to six and the higher rank you have the better job you are going to get when you get out so ranking matters. And what are the two factors that law schools look at for ranking? Faculty +\u00a0 Law Library. Those are the two big factors in what go into the rank. If you have a good faculty and a good Law Library it produces good lawyers that's the idea. That's why the oldest of the law schools are the ones that typically still are the highest ranked. Harvard, Yale, etc. they've been around a very long time okay. Sweattshows up and he's told well when you go to class you actually have to sit in the desk outside the class. Listen through the door you have access to the class but you're out here and they're in there so he does and he tries to engage the professors after the class of before class they won't even talk to him they walled him off.\u00a0 He wants to go and study in the library and he's told no you can't go in there that's a segregated Library. So you have to go use the library downtown. They have a law library downtown you have access to it so go use that one. well, what are the two things that determine the rank? Faculty he has no access to his faculty there's stonewalling him. My library? he's banned from his he has to go use the one downtown which is nowhere near as good as the University of Texas law life. and they're able to make a point hey he's clearly being separated but he's not being treated equal. And ultimately the Supreme Court agrees with sweatt but this is a sort of a mixed victory. All they really say is yes sweat has a case he's absolutely right but the problem isn't the Plessy ruling the problem is the Texas University was not adhering to the Plessy rule they did not give him equal facility the way they were supposed to and that was the problem. So mixed bag they kind of went well we expected more from that. How do we attack this now? And there was a case coming out of Kansas. It was an elementary school case and this one intrigued Marshall he said \"you know what let's change tactics rather than going after the higher ed stuff let's go after kids when they're in their formative years and try to argue that these kids are being screwed up by segregation that is damaging to them and it's causing a permanent problem for the rest of their life of an inferiority complex. let's argue that instead.\" so they took this case Brown be Board of Education until Topeka Kansas all the way up to the Supreme Court the Supreme Court hurt the case in 1953. The problem is shortly after the case was heard, not just any justice, the Chief Justice died. Which means they had to come up with a new chief justice and the president gets to select who they are in this particular case. A new Justice was selected and his name was Earl Warren. Now, Warren what is his belief about segregation? Does he like it? no.\u00a0 Now before the death of the Chief Justice the Supreme Court had been close on the vote but 54 in favor of segregation and maintaining Plessy. but now with Earl Warren replacing one of those boats it swings to fight for the other direction so now the court is poised to overturn Plessy for the first time. When Earl Warren comes in and takes over.\u00a0 And then he's looking through and he pulls out this Brown B.\u00a0 Board of Education case he says Brown B.\u00a0 Board of Education call him back in I want to hear this one argued in person the other justices are going oh no. And so they call him back in Marshall's the case in front of the Supreme Court. And this time, a 54 decision is handed down and it's in favor of brown. The words they use are \"separate is inherently unequal\". They overturn Plessy. What they say is they make a good case that kids are being stigmatized from a young age that they are different therefore lesser than white kids. And that is damaging them for the rest of their lives that is not equal. Now people are saying, well okay does this only apply to education or is this all segregations being struck down I mean did they just up and plus he completely or is it just related to education people are asking that question they don't know and throughout the South they are in a panic. Their entire way of life for the last half of century is being uprooted all over again just like the Civil War uprooted their culture before now it's doing it again. And politicians across the South come together in a big conference all levels of government are in there Senators Congressman, governors, School Board commissioner, mayors, County Supervisors you name it every level of politician is there and they all say okay we have to commit to the people of the South that we are going to fight any effort to desegregate anything. We have to make a pledge and they do they call it the southern Manifesto and all of them put their signature on. They all sign it committing that they will fight desegregation George Wallace mayors Alabama was ordered by the courts to desegregate and two African Americans were admitted to the University of Alabama and we're showing up the register God by the name of James hood and a woman named by Vivian Malone and George Wallace is symbolically standing in the doorway now this is just a symbolic history. He's being seen doing something the only thing he can do but the fact is the FBI and National Guard are already out in force and they know he's going to be moved to side he knows this and he does not resist but he's doing everything he can he's fulfilling his promise. He tries to keep Alabama from being desegregated and he fails and so the first two African Americans are enrolled in the University of Alabama. He stood up to him but he lost. Now George Wallace will later run for president he gets shot when he is in the hospital he receives a very interesting visitor her name is Shirley Chisholm she is the first African American woman ever elected to congress she's also in your readings. And George Wallace actually formed a friendship that lasts the rest of their lives. Largely because of his relationship and probably also by the fact that he got shot he comes to revise his thinking seeing that maybe, his ideas on segregation were bad that he was in the wrong and He suggests that he seen the light send to prevent desegregation efforts from that point on. So he apparently switched sides now whether he did it just as a political maneuver or if he meant it I personally think he meant it because and that friendship that he makes with Shirley Chisholm certainly had a big impact with it so however you come down on it he did publicly come out against segregation by the end.\u00a0</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%205/1460%20Feb%2022/#george-wallace","title":"George Wallace","text":"<p>okay now do you guys recognize this scene. from Forrest Gump.

And the Very year after that decision came down Brown be Board of Education was 54 in 1955 there's a nurse who just got done with the 12-hour shift she's tired she wants to go home get something to eat go to bed and she sits down in the very front seat of a bus and the bus was them couple stops later a white man gets on and sees her sitting in the white section that says you need to move to the back of the bus I want your seat she says there's tons of seats just sit somewhere else he complains to the bus driver bus driver keeps going couple blocks later he sees a cop on the side of the road the bus driver pulls over gets off talks to the cop the cops and she refuses.

And so they agreed to put together a bus boycott. After all they said \" African Americans are 80% of the passengers on the buses in Montgomery 80%! If we stop writing the bus look at all the money they don't get they can only let that go on so long before it hurts too much\" let's send him a message so a lot of people said but I got to get to work so they or they organize instead vanpools we're vanpool drivers will volunteer their time to drive people to work. So they do that instead of the buses. The name of her preacher by the way? Martin Luther King Jr. This is where he becomes famous not just locally but nationally. The bus boycott draws big news. Not just for the boycott but for the response against it the bus drivers start going around on their route nobody black is getting on the bus. And they take a look at the end tallies for the day and say whoa. The money we took in went down that much we can't even pay for the gas much less the salary of the people driving. This has to stop and so the police go out and force trying to stop to pull them over every block play long it is not uncommon for vanpool drivers to get 50 to 100 tickets a day nights. But more than that then they report these people to their insurance companies are you aware that this person has just gotten 500 tickets in the last week? You really should cancel their insurance wow thanks for letting us know you're absolutely right that's they don't know what's going on they don't know they're being used. But that's what ends up starting to happen and then off duty the policeman directly attacked the vanpool drivers as well. they will carve up their cars scratch them crack open eggs on the paint all kinds of stuff. And ultimately Martin Luther King says \" this is just showing them for what they are stay the course.\" we're making inroads here because now it's national news they're getting a spotlight they never had counted on but it also propelled him into the national Limelight where suddenly people across the South are turning to him said hey I have a congregation down in Atlanta I have a congregation down in Birmingham I have a congregation in New Orleans how do you think we should be taking these on Martin Luther King is a relatively young preacher he's only in his mid 30s. He's not an old man. And he suddenly has people who are 20 and 30 years and senior in some cases asking him for his guidance how should we do this. And he is stunned he suddenly comes to a realization that he now has to organize all of these different people and teach them how to properly resist segregation. he says okay let's hold a convention and so they do. It becomes known as the southern Christian leadership conference. In fact he will use that name as his organization's name from that point on Martin Luther King will head the Seven Christian leadership conference which will be the central group of civil rights movement. it will be the biggest most prominent one and they have this big convention where people all over the South are coming to hear his ideas but in order to do that he had to figure out what those ideas were. He had to figure out how to properly approach things. And he said \"hmm, look at resistance leaders barely recently who have been successful have there been any? He says you know what there have been. India.\" India has fought against British colonization for years and only now are they getting their independence right after World War II 1947 Britain pulls out and India receives its independence from the British Empire. He says okay the guy who ran that was Gandhi. What did Gandhi do that was so successful? how did he make it work? he says okay he absorbed he embraced rather this policy of non-violence. Do not use violence. Stay passive stay peaceful and if violence is brought against you don't fight back you will reveal them to be the Thugs and the uncivilized people they accuse you of people. So it essentially turns the table on the aggressors. It shows them to be what they are: thugs. And break the laws that are unjust violate them but do so in a peaceful manner don't use violence. Gandhi was famous for the walk to the Sea where there was assault Monopoly and it was illegal to make salt unless you were licensed by the government and so Gandhi went out to the ocean got a bunch of sea water boil it down to salt. he just violated the law. No violence but that act was symbolic and it spread. He says this is what we need to do. And so he encourages a path of non-resistance. A path or rather resistance but non-violent.\u00a0 So MLK's policy of non violence and others will be inspired to start their own organizations based off of his example. College students for young idealistic and wanted to make a difference themselves they wanted to get involved. They wanted to take on segregation themselves. To be Frontline resistors. he said Dr. King's got a good idea and so a group of four students will go down to a local Woolworths which is sort of like a scaled-down version of Walmart I guess and there was a lunch counter there they will go to the Lunch Counter which was segregated only whites were allowed to sit at the counter blacks can buy food from there but they had to take it as take out. And the four students three whites and one black sat down at the lunch table. The person there said sorry we can't serve you now if you want to buy food and take it to go we can do that. And they said no we we like it here. We want to order and he refuses to take their order we're pretty soon a crowd starts to form. And the crowd gets bigger and then they start abusing these people.\u00a0</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%205/1460%20Feb%2022/#sit-in","title":"Sit-In","text":"<p>Here's the sit-in at Woolworths this was really when the Civil Rights movement grew. it went beyond just the local church leaders into everyone this was seen photographed and it ran as national news and it inspired sit-ins to be spreading across the country and also this woman here Ella Baker becomes one of the big leaders of the civil rights movement because of this. She was one of the people who helped form a new student organization for the entire country it was called the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee otherwise known as sncc. The student on violent Coordinating Committee is basically taking Martin Luther King's ideas of nonviolence and running with it. The sit-ins spread to over 140 cities across America. And almost all of them are met with some kind of violence. Now, when people stand up to it, they are met with tear gas, beatings, but they're really ugly one? Fire hoses. Yeah you don't really think of them as bad do you but, Riot 101 people. I'm going to give you certain rules that you follow in a riot okay? Number one if the government ever brings out the fire hoses? run. Don't stay there. The water is moving at 120 mph that's faster than a major league baseball and it hits with the same force that getting hit with a baseball would in fact worse it will pick you up and throw you. And then there's the impact what it hits you that hurts. And the pressure of the water is so abrasive it's scratching you up but then there's the impact to the ground when you fall but then it still doesn't stop they keep the fire hose on you and it's pushing you on the ground. Road rash. Not fun yeah. If they ever bring out the fire hoses and you're around go the other way okay rule number one fire hoses bad. Okay. We'll cover other what to do in a riot thing later.</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%205/1460%20Feb%2022/#martin-luther-king-jr","title":"Martin Luther King Jr.","text":"<p>We've got some rights to talk about. Okay. So all of this is going on and I want to come back to this one here. Elevated even further with the I Have a Dream speech the March on Washington in 1963 what is he urging here now how many of you have seen this? Probably four or five times. Yeah okay. Do I Have a Dream speech is specifically calling for a type of action to be put in and that action is voting. He's encouraged blacks to get out and vote he knows that a lot of people aren't even enrolled to vote. They're not even on the voting rolls. So he wants to get people active he wants to get the vote out there and the one thing that Southerners have fought since the end of the Civil War Keith blacks away from the poles they come up with all sorts of ways to try to do it. Well, here he is advocating for this black activism get out and vote. And what's more, the following year 1964 is a presidential election year. Now this is the time of a lot of turmoil in America this speech was given the same year that Kennedy was killed. Kennedy was assassinated in 63 and he was starting to put out some civil rights legislation that Johnson will actually follow up and push through because of the increase of violence in '64. '64 the summer before that presidential election which is in November coming up was known as Freedom Summer where people went all over the South trying to get blacks registered to vote. It got ugly. in Mississippi three college students who were down there locally trying to get people enrolled wound up killed and dumped in a local swamp. That will set off race riots and Mississippi suddenly Goes Up in Flames even made a movie called Mississippi Burning based on this. The violence in Mississippi was only one instance of all of the resistance coming against them how many have you seen that movie Selma it's fairly recent so I figure some of you may have seen it, anyone, one? nobody. Well they actually did a pretty good job of this Freedom March that they took from Selma to Montgomery the King was leading and this was part of Freedom Summer. Ultimately they were successful in getting a lot more black voting in that election and Johnson was elected president. This was an interesting time Martin Luther King as a result of Freedom Summer and as I Have a Dream speech will be given the Nobel Peace Prize and he was the youngest recipient ever to receive the award in history. That was pretty significant. Now I want to come back to Kennedy here for a minute. Kennedy was a Democrat. What party was the big supporter of segregation? The Democrats were. This is when the roles switch. This is when the Republican Party becomes absorbed with the anticivil rights mentality and the Democratic party s*** this is when the switch happens and Kennedy is largely the reason for it in 1960 Kennedy's running for president. and his brother Bobby is saying hey Jack. Let's campaign on the Civil Rights thing we want to be on the right side of history. and JFK says \"thats dangerous\" a lot of our political support is coming from Southern Democrats and if we alienate him we're going to lose big. Nieces and Bobby says yeah but the times right. and Kennedy ultimately says if an opportunity presents itself maybe I'll intervene but otherwise let's play a safer route. let's not campaign on the issue. Well during the campaign in 1960 Martin Luther King was arrested at a rally in Atlanta. he was thrown in jail illegally. Bobby came in and said hey Jack did you hear about what they did the king down in Atlanta? This is we should get involved here you said you wanted an instance well this is a this is a good one. and JFK says okay use your contacts in the bureau and get them sprung. But we're not campaigning on it just do it because it's the right thing to do Bobby says I can live with that fine. Bobby comes up people in the bureau that he has worked with and he uses his influence to get Martin Luther King out of jail. And when that happens words starts to filter out hey did you hear that Kennedy actually used his contacts to get Martin Luther King free? Oh yeah I bet he's going to campaign on it now watch he's going to tell everybody that all the great big Democratic party is now in support of black right sure they are. And Kennedy doesn't say a word. And people are going wait he's not campaigning on me don't tell me he did it just because it was the right thing to do. And suddenly people say, wow. He got Martin Luther King out of jail and then didn't campaign on it he just did it because he wanted to. And all of a sudden blacks across the South are going wow this is a guy we can get behind and he pulls a massive amount of the black vote in the South and that was a big reason why he was elected he won that election to a certain extent based on the increase vote from the African-Americans in the South because of what he did to get King out of jail. They are cautious in the Kennedy administration about civil rights but they want to do something. The next one that I want to talk about involves a lot of political interactions and decisions that the Kennedys have to make and this group is called the Congress on Racial equality otherwise known as core.</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%205/1460%20Feb%2022/#freedom-ride","title":"Freedom Ride","text":"<p>It is an organization that is led by a man named James Farmer and they like sncc, want to use Kings philosophy to force desegregation and they specifically Target buses. they call them Freedom ride. They have a plan. they want to get people paired up a black and a white Rider on a bus. The ride starts in North Carolina the upper South goes all the way down to Georgia and Florida and then all the way across the Deep South through Alabama through Mississippi into Louisiana ending in New Orleans. That is a dangerous route. They know that in life in all likelihood some or maybe even all of them will face physically abusive actions along the way. The president hears about it and specifically ask them not to do it. They advise them don't do this but they do it anyway. Eventually they will stand in front of the buses and stop them and demand that the people get out well they're sitting there holding baseball bats and chains do you think the people want to get off the bus oh no. So they stay on the Bus Say no no we're not getting out so they set the bus on fire and said okay don't get out. Stay there. Well of course they're going to get out at that point if they can't breathe they're coughing uncontrollably when they get off the bus from smoke inhalation and as soon as they get off the bus the people have in on them. Start hammering them and ultimately send a whole bunch of people into the hospitals some of them with very significant injuries. When word gets back to the Kennedys about what's going on. Robert Kennedy basically means the head federal law enforcement officer of the US government as attorney general he orders the federal law enforcement agencies to escort the Freedom Riders to ensure that they are no longer attacked for the remainder of their trip. Throughout Mississippi many of them were arrested and sentenced to the worst prison in Mississippi where they take the prisoners out and use them for heavy hard labor. And he's sending a message even 90 days of this is absolutely miserable. And that's what he wants to encourage saying hey that's fine you want to break the wall we'll send you to prison. And that's how Mississippi combats them. a lot of people end up getting arrested and put in prisons in Mississippi for this. So hostility is starting to rise and new organizations are coming to the Forefront by the mid-60s a lot of people are frustrated that change is not happening fast enough now actually it is it's happening pretty quick. when Johnson gets word of this as president he will take Kennedy's policies and push him through Kennedy it already proposed a civil rights act that would eliminate all the voting restrictions that the NAACP has been protesting for half a century. Johnson pushes that through and becomes known as the Civil Rights Act of 1965 that is the one that is the big law that levels the voting playing field same ballots same rules apply to everyone no more restricting anyone's right to vote. Take it on. Give them that protection. So this was the turning point this is when WB The Voice finally get to see the ultimate victory of all the things he's been fighting for since the NAACP was formed he lived to see all of that succeed. And yet people are still frustrating especially younger generation people. College students have not lived very long, and because of that when things take a little longer than they want them to, they lose their patience a whole lot quicker than people have been alive for 50 years or longer. You kind of get a slightly different sense of how long things take and when you're a kid they put you in a corner for misbehaving for 5 minutes it feels like you've been there for 5 hours doesn't it. Time feels different to different ages. And the college students especially are getting impatient. they're not seeing change happen fast enough they wanted to happen now. And they're not getting them now changes happening it's taking time it's going through a process but it is. But the frustration leads some people to say King's approach of non-violence is not working. Maybe we need to take the gloves off maybe we need to start fighting back when they bring violence to us we bring violence back to them. We don't initiate but we respond in kind. We stand up for ourselves. This is the rise of what becomes known as the black Power move. One reason things are starting to turn violent is because of a riot. In 1965 in Watts South Central Los Angeles spend it down by Compton. African Americans after World War II found some real problems in their employment a lot of them had moved out to California to work in the wartime factories but when the war time Factory started closing and they got laid off they start looking for other jobs but they're not getting hired. Before long the unemployment rate in South Central Los Angeles climbs to 25%, one in four people is out of work now to give you perspective on that the worst unemployment rate in US history as a nation was in 1932 and it was 25%. that was the worst year of the Great Depression.\u00a0 This is what South Central is going through in the mid 60s that level of unemployment and rather than recognizing the hardships and helping them find jobs, the police instead start getting more and more heavy-handed with the people who are getting desperate in that town. Police brutality is on the rise. Unjust arrests are on the rise. All sorts of violations of people's rights LAPD has a really really poor history in dealing with that. Okay they've done some pretty ugly things over the years we're going to see some of them. Ultimately what strikes the match Sparks this whole thing was not actually any kind of a violation of a guy civil rights. It was a drunk driving stop. A police officer saw a car weaving all over the place pulled them over get a sobriety check the guy was drunk like crazy. So he handcuffs him sits him down on the curb and wait for a tow truck to tow his car away from a distance people see this. And they go what did he do wrong he didn't do anything why is he being cut? Well they don't realize that he's being arrested for drunk driving when she was guilty of and pretty soon the story grows as stories do. did you hear what the cops did to this guy they cut them and then started kicking him and then it grew even more did you hear about it they put them in the hospital he's in critical condition no reason at all they just killed the guy. They arrested him put them in lock up and then when he's sobered up they cited him and turned him loose. Just what you do with any other drunk driver. Okay so they handled it right. But because of the history of abuse people were willing to believe the worst about LAPD and had they done those things before? Absolutely. LAPD has done this before. more desperate they're having work rallies the Watts Riots start up and they are disastrous. Riot rule number two. If you're ever in a riot, don't tear up your own town. Go to another town. Yeah burning down your local businesses hurts your neighbors. People that are just as frustrated as you are. You want to do that go to another town where people aren't dealing with those same problems make those problems their problems okay so Riot number two don't write it in your own neighbor. Get out of town.\u00a0</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%205/1460%20Feb%2022/#watts-riot-1965","title":"Watts Riot (1965)","text":"<p>And there are more coming we've got another right okay but the police start moving out in force. the National Guard is slow to responding the reason is it the governor of California was actually out of the country in Greece on vacation.

Martin Luther. good and his ideas sparked a big uproar and a controversy that ultimately will result in a massive split of the Christian church based in Rome the Protestant Reformation. So what we actually are going to see here is a result to different directions the Protestant Reformation ended up going. As the Protestant Reformation was largely started based on Luther's ideas, you have them being the core group of protestant reformers but others are going to come up disagreeing with Luther on several points and creating options. One of the big thinkers other than Martin Luther that was coming up with one of these big branches of protestantism is someone named John Calvin. And followers of his ideas are called Calvinists okay so followers of Luther's ideas become known as lutherans. The lutherans and Calvinists. And from there they go into even bigger divide as they continue breaking up so what is the big difference between Luther's ideas and Calvin's ideas they matter because Luther's ideas are really The Heart Of The Rising Protestant movement it's going to be Lucas ideas that a lot of the kings of Europe will latch on to when they create their own but Calvin is going to have a big impact so what is that what exactly is really the motivation behind the spreading out of the Protestant Reformation it's not just a personal issue for people it's a political issue Kings across Europe are tired of the Pope interfering in their Kingdom there is a big well of authority and they want to be the biggest fish in that pond they want control of their own country and every time the Catholic Church comes in and says you being so and so cannot do this way the pope doesn't like you doing this well they're tired of having to answer to the Post Authority they want control of everything going on in their country and Luther says you don't have to do what Rome says as a matter of fact you don't have to be associated with them at all there's nothing that says the church has to be set up the way they did it you can set up your own church and be perfectly fine you're not putting your soul in danger you don't have to do instead set up your own church and be the head of it yourself if you do that then the authority comes to one person the king becomes not just the political Authority but also the religious Authority in this truck now they already relied on what they called The Vine right divine right of King the justification for King's holding that Throne saying God shows us or this they still got selected us to be king that's what Kings have relied on but it also implies that the Kings had to stay in line with the Catholic church now Luther's giving them a weapon of Their Own church and set up your own you don't have to do what they tell you to do for a lot of people they also were looking at ideas about salvation the afterlife they want to go to heaven they don't want to go to hell Luther says all you have to do to go to heaven is have faith in God and accept through Grace that He sent Jesus to be sacrificed for your sins you can accept that salvation but it requires just your choice now here's the rub he believes the individual has the choice to choose or not choose that path therefore the path of whether you go to heaven or not is not already planned out the individual can make that choice this plays into the Enlightenment thinking the enlightenment heavily focuses on the rights of the individual people like John Locke are saying you have a right to life you have a right to Liberty you have a right to property natural rights natural laws well this is playing into that mindset to a certain extent it's focusing on this new Focus of the individual being the center of things this is what's happening throughout Europe at this point and so it really gives you kind of a humanist approach to why people are following Luther. He's saying you have that choice you have that power as an individual to choose to go to heaven or health Calvin on the other hand says Nope Calvin believes that everything is already predestined. God already knows who's going to heaven or hell you don't really have a choice you have an illusion of choice you can put your salvation at risk by completely rejecting it but as far as going to heaven you have to earn it each and every day you have to earn it with everything you say everything you think everything you do you have to earn it submission to the will of God is Paramount but everything is already predestined and going against God's plan is the greatest sin you can commit because it doesn't just put you in Jeopardy he puts society's a hole in Jeopardy in other words they believe that people who are going against God's will can endanger the entire country that's why they're so concerned about what's wrong with England Church of England they think it's been corrupted by involving it in politics the way the King has it has been screwed up and they believe they're putting the lives the future of all the people in England at risk and so they want to purify it that's why they become known as things have gone too far they can't fix it it's irreparably screwed up it can't be fixed are only choice here is really to break off from the church of England and create a new entity start over again these people become known as separatists Puritans and separatists believe the same thing they don't want the corrupt political decisions screwing up their society they believe a purpose Society is attainable what do we call that what's that Utopia good Utopia this idea that you can build a perfect Society well that is very much connected with these ideas they are floating about the Colonials existence in America they want to do that and they believe it's possible build a perfect Society one where religion is practice properly and they create a government and laws that enforce that to force the conscience and curb the will those are their work force the conscious and curb the will everything is predestined God has a plan and your job is to carry that plan out make sure that you were doing your part to forward that plan otherwise you risk damnation for everyone not just yourself so they've got an interest in everybody following the rules and what do you think it would be like to live in a society like that if this is their core belief system anyway very strict yes they come up with laws that are very very rigid and then once they come up with those logs what do they do about it everybody's watching everybody else constantly to keep an eye on whether somebody is stepping over the line or not how's that sound people are constantly budding into your business constantly looking at everything you do everything is under scrutiny that sounds fun does that sound like they're coming here for Religious Freedom this isn't the recipe for freedom is it the politicians are religious leaders they're both and that's what makes up theocracy for example the Vatican the home of the Catholic Church the Vatican it exists entirely within the city of Rome but it is in fact its own country and the pope is the head of that country Connecticut is a good example of a theocracy so several examples the Taliban when they took over Afghanistan when we left they reassured their Authority the Taliban is a political entity that is controlled by religion so again there's another theocracy theocracy still exists they created one in the New England colonies when they went in there okay so what is it that they do what is their big the big thing that they're known for strict enforcement of morality but not just privately they're doing it publicly they use embarrassment humiliation and shame as the big enforcement tools to try to convince people to follow the rules is very effective nobody wants to be embarrassed publicly but if you screw up you don't just get punished everybody gets to watch you being punched that's the point so it's not just teaching you it's convincing everybody else hey I better not do the same thing otherwise this is going to happen to me too and I don't want this to happen to me so when they're they are working for the good of the entire group that's the mindset part of this is not only to say you've got a conscience they are forcing you to follow it thanks if your conscience is telling you to do something don't go against it follow it do what you know to be right they want to curb over exuberance of Youth now how many of you remember what it was like being in junior high your early teenage years we already forgot yeah there we go where you screwed up we all work by definition you're kind of screwed up your body is going through all sorts of changes the hormonal stuff causes you to do all kinds of weird stuff you end up being a problem child for a couple weeks a little better but most people in one way or another really do stupid stuff it doesn't necessarily need to be bad stuff well part of it is you act out you feel like all of a sudden you need to be seen be push or being an individual starts to take over everybody wants to be a grown up about that point they act like kids but insist on being treated like adults and then when they get treated like adults they complain ing and early teenager special so they want to control the natural exuberance of you they want to keep kids under control and you've heard that saying children are better seeing than not heard yeah some people are going no never heard that yeah better seen than hurt you have basically the Puritans live by this kids are great to try it out and be orderly but you don't want to open their mouth so they do a lot of social repression of the kids kids are heavily under control but they're not the only one this is what Puritans look like not some not most. Replace the face but they all look like this why because there are rules on what they can wear and what they can first rule can lead to lust lust meets the sin and sin is forbidden remember this it will come to be a recurrency you can wear white they live in a monochrome world no colors but there are a couple exceptions to this now if you are male and you are fairly wealthy so you have a certain amount of wealth and you have particularly High standing in society you might might be able to get away occasionally with wearing a dark blue suit but that's correct most people can't even get away with that let's take a look at the components and what they are designed to do notice men and women are very heavily covered up when they're outside men are expected to wear hats they can take them off inside women however wearing a cloth they can only really take it off for two reasons sex that's it the rest of the time they keep their hair covered now the interesting obsession with hair it's covered but at the same time women aren't supposed to cut their hair their hair is supposed to be long long hair is a sign of femininity sign of being a woman and so if your hair is too long as a man they take issue with you men's hair is supposed to be short why are standards they can actually grow it fairly long before they get into what's considered long hair it can be down to your shoulders what we would think of this well that's pretty long hair that's still reasonable if it's down that far you have to pull your hair back neatly keep it keep it neat but if it gets it back for women however you're not allowed to cut your hair short you need to keep your hair long they make them grow their hair long and then they tell him they have to keep it covered all the time could it be because hair is seen as something that can induce less for men so they have to cover their hair most of the day they even sleep in this thing they wear that while they sleep actually men were sleeping cats too that was something they did now if you're having sex you can take it off for sex then when it's time to go to sleep I don't know anymore is whoa very rude that's that's really Crossing line you know forget the dropping cleavage line now to ensure that most of their skin around their neck is covered men mean while wear rough lace is something they are also forbidden this is not considered lace this fabric lace is something that is really and it's meant to be especially feminine if you know wearing lace we sin sin is forbidden there are other things that play here as well women your dress much must have your dress must happen it's supposed to touch the top of their shoe contacts no ankle showing showing ankle is scandalously loose that would be like today if somebody was if women were going around without a shirt on that would be the rough equivalent of showing ankles it's way too much any showing of the ankle oh my God their skin covered up as much as possible too so men even though the style of pants is different than the women wearing dresses they still are expected to keep their legs covered even there's their shirts and coats the must go all the way to him must go all the way to the hand men can go out in public without wearing gloves but women women are expected to wear gloves in public on what they wear there's other things as well family relations within the home are very specific the men are always in charge the children are expected to do with their parents tell them both mom and dad but the wife is expected to obey her husband they take that seriously if she's not obedient to her husband if she's mouthing off to her husband her husband actually can file charges against her in the law take legal action against her will come to that one in here in a minute if you want to date if a young man wants to ask you out a young woman he has to get permission from the parents before even asking her and if the parents say no no means no this is not an area they can mess around with a little bit as a whole is seen as a distraction from doing your duty to God and you're wasting God's time therefore entertainment is forbidden now they can have like a play or something like that you can do that if it's teaching some kind of moral lesson it's encouraging morality it's encouraging people to follow the rules or show examples of people breaking those rules and watching get punished for it there's a little different then it becomes educational and it's forwarding God's plan at that point for those are okay laziness idleness wasting God's time now here's another one and this one on the surface it doesn't sound like it would be all that stuff no sleeping in church not allowed to sleep in church now if you go to church today most churches most religions most church services are what an hour hour and a half different day not theirs 4 hours on Sunday and as if one four hour. Wouldn't have been enough they actually have an evening service too and you're required to be at both yes the evening one usually lasts for 2 and 1/2 hours so six and a half hours of church every Sunday and they also usually meet on Wednesdays too in addition to that you sometimes have Bible study should go through what not but you get the idea lots of time spent in church and getting up Sunday morning and going to church and sitting there for 4 hours the preachers tend to be avoiding any excessive emotionalism because excessive emotionalism can lead to sin sin is forbidden so they tried to keep it as calm as possible churches required you are allowed to miss church only if you are ill but then they will send somebody over to check on they will be coming specifically they bring over some soup they want to see if there's anything they can do for you to help you out show that they care but what are they really doing checking to see if you're sick if you are hey you're some soup hope you feel better if you're not expectations thanks so let's take a look at some of the punishments they have and some of the reasons they have for them one comic common public humiliation is having to wear a letter on your clothing to identify what it was you did wrong how many of you have heard or read good number yeah I know super entertaining add me the kind of thing that you could actually probably watch but the Scarlet Letter here we are this was actually one of the earliest movies filmed version of Scarlet Letter ever put out the silent film era and she was starting his history what made it worse is she wasn't ashamed of it and she refused to give up the man who she had sex with but he did get her pregnant and she wasn't ashamed of the child on the contrary she was proud of her the man who got her pregnant was the priest spoiler alert sorry I know a lot of you are really interested to run right out and rent The Scarlet Letter read it watch it whatever I want to talk about some of the letters you can get okay she got an A if you burn down somebody's house arson you'd probably get a d if you were drunk in public so drunkenness you get a deed you can get a B for any number of things burglary you burglarize somebody's house but burglary blasphemy you bless me against the church after all if you are a bastard did you actually do anything wrong no you are a result of your parents doing something wrong but who can stigmatized you do is that fair come on now I can understand the parents having to wear a bee on their clothes everywhere they go yes we had a bastard child for fornication now what's the difference between fornication and adultery one or both of the people involved is married to someone else fornication you get two single people who are having premarital sex sex outside of wedlock that's fornication you might also get an F if you forged something for the document you can wear now you get an eye if you think your sister's really cute this device here is the pillar although if you call it stocks nobody's going to correct it the whole idea here is to put you on display for everybody coming by to say oh they're there because they did this sometimes they will even go so far as to put buckets of rotten fruit and vegetables next to this encouraging people to throw it at you you got to be careful about that though you take too much Glee and throwing rotten food at people but wait until it's your turn in the stocks and they'll get to pay back so this one looks incredibly uncomfortable you can get anywhere from an hour or two bent over like this first of all your back is going to start hurting really quick and bathroom breaks nope getting to have food or water while you're there unless someone's kind enough to feed you nope so that could end up getting really really miserable painful hungry messing yourself so messy stinky yeah it it all adds up it's not pleasant being in these things particular punishment that is largely reserved for women the Duncan School remember how I said women who disobey their husband or nap off to them could end up getting dragged into court this is often the punishment that they get a trip on the decking school it's seen in a couple different basic formats one where is at the end of a long plank on a fulcrum where they get lowered down in there and then pull back up or they're on a rope that gets lowered in but basically strap the woman in the chair and you dunk her in the water the whole idea here is the woman has too much inner fire and you're quenching that's why you're ducking her in the water quench that fire there was actually a rather famous poem written about the specific incident where a woman had been accused of disobeying and abusing her husband three times where it got drawn into court I do have it sometimes I read it but basically it's telling the actual account of the story where the first time the guy brings her in she takes a trip on the stool the second time she didn't learn her lesson she gets another trip into the water the third time the judge the jury everybody in the courtroom couldn't keep a straight face everybody was laughing she's not going to respond to this so tell you what why don't we just put her in jail for a couple days and find her and otherwise we let it go they thought it was amusing that she was getting dragged into court yet one more time so he kind of get an idea this might have been a source of private entertainment watching women get dumped into the water not exactly nice is it being publicly logged with a bull whip they had a whipping post at the center of town you get strapped into that and then they go to town on you usually the sentence is 40 Lashes sometimes for more serious offenses that might even give you more lashes than that but 40 Lashes is, what they might give you lashing for doing it was an example of a man named Edward Preston who was sentenced to 40 Lashes his crime come inside of me in other words he had a homosexual sex with another man and they worked in 40 times for that tongue piercing was something else that was also sometimes you that is where they taking all aw that's for those of you know basically around shaft that comes to a point at the end they used it for poking holes in leather punch and what they would do is they would take that sharp pointy piece of Steel and stick it in the fire until it glowed white hot the reason if you don't cauterize it it will heal back up and it will close they want that hole to be permanent so when they jab it and have it cauterized they just leave it sitting there until it's well and truly Cooks the area around it and forever from that point on you have a hole in your car for serious blasphemy and running a foul of both religious and Civil Authorities who are really offended at whatever you said so criticizing the church criticizing the state or incredible blasting you might see you get this also another thing they might do here nailing they might nail your ear to the wood next to it so you're in there jammed in which is bad enough but now your ears nailed this thing owl for some serious offenses they might even cut your ear off completely execution is an option would people be executed while committing murder if it was clear that you intended to kill somebody you planned it out and you killed them you can be tried for murder and get capital punishment usually capital punishment that you were home but sometimes they will burn you at the state it depends on the violation here's an interesting one of somebody who was executed for his crimes his name was Thomas Granger he also was in Plymouth by the way he was saying he was convicted of the crime of buggery what yeah he was accused of having sex with a mirror that's a female horse a cow Two Goats five sheep two calves not quite sure how they manage that the animals were executed as well and burned Christmas had completely tainted them and they were afraid that these would be can take over the animals and do which people this wasn't all of them Massachusetts Bay Massachusetts Rhode Island for example but it wasn't all of them it wasn't like this in Virginia it wasn't like this in the Carolinas it wasn't like this in a lot of a lot of the other ones as well so this was specifically for them another thing they might do is letter branding if you violate something multiple times you might actually get branded with the letter wearing it clearly wasn't enough you really had to remind people just how much that person has done he was a common one for this theme if somebody repeatedly stole things they would actually typically brand someone with a t on their hands the obvious messages watch out that hand is used to conducting the five finger distance something that was also fairly common if you were caught stealing repeatedly you get a tea branded in here or constantly engaging in adultery for example you might get an a branded into you but they would use or whatever and if you did it multiple times even after that they probably brand you on all that thing ran it in the forehead Randy tell him the bend over another interesting group to look at that also and his dad was fairly powerful he was a noble and he was influential he was friends with King Charles II but King Charles II had some problems mainly he liked the Gamble a lot and when he ran out of money at the gambling table so you would go to a friend of his and say hey can you loan me some money I'll pay you back later he never did he just kept losing money and losing money and losing money but how do you say no to the king sorry your majesty I'm just not going to loan it to you because you're not trustworthy well William Penn's father was one of the people who were friends with the King and moan him quite a bit of money that was gambled away and at a certain point 12 seconds often times found that people were willing to accept Colonial Charters which was a way to make money as repayment for their debt and in the case of the pen family what's more is Charleston's second multiple advantages in this he knew that 10 son was a Quaker and he took a lot of abuse had a lot of friends who were Quakers and he wanted to provide a place where Quakers could go and not be persecuted what's more the king loved the idea because it meant to Quakers would be now on the other side of the Atlantic and he wouldn't have to deal with me provide Quakers a safe haven over on the other side of the ocean when he set up the rules they were generally according to Quaker their actual name was the religious Society of Friends have you ever heard of Philadelphia being called the City of Brotherly Love that's his nickname well it comes from this route of Quakers brotherly love to look upon each other fondly and basically treat others the way you would want to be treated being quicker is technically a religion but at the same time you could be Christian and Quaker at the same time it was possible for the two to exist it was also possible to be Quaker in an atheist yeah it would overlap other religions fairly well Quakers believe every person is born with an inner life they might say oh well that's the Holy Spirit that's God's talking to you from inside telling you what's right and wrong or not necessarily religious people they might simply say no that's just your consciousness in any case Quakers believe every person is born knowing what is right they're born with that little voice inside of them telling them right from wrong that inner life and that inner light has a Quaker you're supposed to listen to it and do what it tells you to do follow your conscience the core beliefs there's actually four core principles but the one most associated with Quaker the one that people most associate with them it's Pacific peace I don't believe in using violence system dis pute dispute should be settled peaceful verbally you can argue all you want but don't let it come to blow and they're really against War I hate War waiters make great diplomats they're natural for that they believe all people have good within them this is one area where they kind of run a fellow of Christian Church Christianity holds that all people are born evil they are born to sin and they have to be redeemed from that so you are not born good you're born evil Quakers say no everybody's actually born with Gooden and that voice is telling them what is right and what is not it is the voice of good another area where they tend to differ from Christianity Christianity holds the principle of Sola scriptura in other words the only path to Salvation is the one explained in the Bible in the scriptures there is no other way to get salvation then to follow the path put in the Bible that's the only way the Quaker say no I don't believe that I believe that it is APAP to Salvation or could be a path of salvation but they also believe that there could be other paths there are other ways of attaining Salvation other than what's written there so in a way Hinduism kind of kind of goes along these lines too Hinduism there isn't just one type of Hinduism there's a whole bunch of Hinduism mineral lumped under one label but there's a lot of different ways to achieve the goals that he was in the setting out different methods different approaches there's a lot of paths you can take what Quakers believe that too that one way isn't necessarily the only way there could be other alternatives another thing they believe is you should not have one person telling you how to practice how to believe or what to believe they don't like the idea of having one priest telling everybody how they should practice their religion instead they believe in what's called they believe everybody instead of being in a situation basically like you are now group of people with a person up front which is how most churches meet right you have a priest well that's not but Quakers do Quakers and anybody who wants to talk in a Quaker service is welcome to all they have to do is just stand up it doesn't matter if you're 60 years old or if it's 6 years old it doesn't matter if your male or female it doesn't matter if you are rich or poor High status low status no status none of that matters everybody has the right priesthood of all believers so before principles we talked about the first one pacifism the second one equality they believed the concept of equality that all people regardless of money regardless of titles regardless of genders regardless of days everybody is equal integrity they believe that Integrity is vital to a person that basically your word is your bond what you know to be right you should act on and if you say things and then don't abide by them or you are frequently lying about things and you're untrustworthy you lack integrity so they're basically saying your reputation matters how you conduct yourself making sure that your actions and your words are joined that's important that's the third president don't overly complicate things and do that and they believe you can practice moderation it's okay to have a cookie out of the cookie jar just don't empty the cookie jar in one city okay isn't bad but taking in moderation you can enjoy the pleasures of the flesh just keep it free so all of that is kind of part of Simplicity your life but still don't be afraid to have fun now the Quakers are absolutely detested by the periods appearance hate these guys every time Quakers come to town they start talking openly about their own ideas Quakers love to argue they love to provoke and stimulate arguments this is something they enjoy your favorite past time well the Puritan colonies they don't appreciate anybody who has a dissenting view from what the dominant view is that's a crime and so when Quakers go in there they're told to stop doing what they're doing and they continue they will get hauled into court and usually they will face Spanish no one famous case there was a group of four Quakers and this one is significant because one of them was a woman very few women were actually executed in puritan society it's mainly men who are being executed but in this particular one of those four they had gone into Boston and started talking about their ideas brought up before a magistrate who then vanished them they broke the banishment and came back in and started doing it again this time they sentenced them to death here they are on their way to the gala in the background they got that arrested there and Mary Dyer was famous because she was one of those four people executed so in effect in New England now William Penn allowed for a lot of freedom he charged very little rent he made some modest profit on his Colony but it wasn't exorbitant the tax rate were far lower than most of the colonies which the people love and it was a pretty easy going guy he let people basically run the colony themselves it was more of a democracy than any of the other colonies really approach there was one thing that he insisted on and during his lifetime he absolutely rigidly made sure that they followed it do not steal land from Indians and this is straight out of his Quaker police why what happens if you steal land from Indians they come back and what yeah they'll attack you so in other words stealing land from Indians what is it likely to do retaliation is likely to cause the war in other words violence they are pacifists they're supposed to avoid the possibility of violence so he's saying if you steal Land from the Indians eventually they're going to get angry and attack your actions are directly causing Warfare and therefore if you want land from Indians make a deal with them freedom for it don't just steal it and people grumbled and complained but actually Pennsylvania ended up having much better relations with their neighbor in Indians than other groups do and it ended up being a much more stable and Safe Community to be in in a lot of the other colonies work so this actually ended up being very beneficial to Pennsylvania at least while William Penn was alive when he died they threw that out and they started doing things the way others did with predictable results violence there is one more Colony I want to mention and then I'll let you go the colony is Maryland similar to the pen family the Calvert family also we're friends with the King King Charles II and when he ran short of money because of gambling they frequently was loan him money he calverts specifically Lord Baltimore that was his title that's why Baltimore is the capital of Maryland today they named it after this guy okay so he gets the calverts a charter and they are Catholic the ability to set up a place where Catholics can go to avoid persecution the problem is when they put out that announcement oh yeah we're going to invite Catholics to come 90% of the people who come are actually they're coming for economic reasons start tobacco Plantation and it ends up causing a lot of problems between the Catholics and the Protestants there but it too was another Colony established for religious reasons specifically a Haven for Quakers New England was largely set up as Protestants Havens ones where the Protestants Calvinists especially were in control of that okay that's a good place to break so I will turn you loose now just a reminder Monday what's that do we meet on Monday no OK Google sometime during the day it's open from 12:00 a.m. All the way till 11:59 p.m. It's open for basically a 24 hour window all right</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%207/1460%20Mar%2008/","title":"1460 Mar 08","text":"<ul> <li>First great awakening <ul> <li>caused

desperate for consumer goods and in the early. Of the 1800s we are having some conflicts Religion a lot of people started saying you know these people are clearly out of control it's about time that they get taken out of control of the colonial government up there and there's this pushback against the religion that had been controlling that area and it ends up radiating throughout the colonial culture so essentially there's this listening against religious ideals and that doesn't mean that they abandon him but a lot of people are saying you know let's get away from this extremism and at the same time people are also pushing the Enlightenment thinkers they're talking about all of the people who have been writing about things like natural law the natural rights of people life liberty and property and all of the ideas that ultimately will lead to the revolution but they're being put forth largely in a secular way and what starts to happen is you see a battlefield really emerged between the Enlightenment ideas of the secular meeting the religious ideas and so this secret and profane secular versus religious battle Collision is going on in Europe but it's also going on in the colonies in a different way the colonies have seen a big reduction of the influence of religion and a lot of the religiously minded people are really concerned about what's happening to the people during this. Of time there's also a big upsurge in consumerism which we'll talk about the third section in depth but a lot of people look at the increased materialism The increased secularism the pulling away from religious ideals as being troubling they're seeing the patterns that are radiating through America and they're bothered by it so there is a concern within the religious core that's still there but by and large things kind of stagnate religiously in America until really the 1730s all right excuse me the 17th now I don't normally care whether you know years or not but it's a good idea to understand the context of when this is happening to understand why it's significant in 1739 a man named George Whitfield it's spelled Whitefield it looks like it should be pronounced Whitefield he's a preacher over in England and he comes to the colonies in North America and stages a number of revivals for 2 years he's out here for 2 years and he starts in Georgia works his way up the Atlantic Seaboard All the Way North and then he works his way all the way back down south and then he goes back to England so it was only just a two-year stint that he was here but it had the equivalent of almost dropping a bomb in America it was dramatic. The Revival he launched was one that incorporated more emotion he said why should you exclude emotionality from religion instead you should embrace it because that's essentially God inspiring you so he talks about feeling your religion applying your religion it's not enough to just acknowledge it acknowledgeably give it essentially a mental agreement but to actually embrace it to feel it to live it and essentially he is the strike on a match that a lot of the religious community have been waiting for somebody who is really reaching people in their heart and he becomes really the first true evangelist in the process he also sparked something that will be called the Great Awakening we will refer to it as the first Great Awakening we're going to talk about both the first and the second today. As more and more people got fired up about the religion they also became very fanatical about it and when that happens their way becomes the right way and anybody who doesn't agree with them becomes the enemy even if that disagreement is just a little narrow thing that it's not a big difference between one group and another their way is wrong our way is right and this will turn into some pretty heated conflicts and a lot of religion battling other religious groups you'll start seeing it turn into violence at times where one group will assault others in various ways one thing that became something that was rather famous was one particular denomination really hated another church is approach to things and decided to one day wait until their Sunday service where they brought in a whole bunch of rabid dogs turn them loose in the church and then block the doors to keep the dogs in there hoping that those rabid dogs would bite people and give them rabies so this is not a nice friendly oh let's all embrace the religious ideas and start working together these religious up surgeons of all these various groups radicalize people to the point where they start fighting with each other and it absolutely rips colonial society apart at the scene this kind of Hysteria has been something that Captain arms length and now it's just erupting like crazy all over the place discrimination on religion turns into widespread persecution people start attacking Catholics the Protestant versus Catholic battle starts happening also another thing that starts happening that really hasn't been a big factor in the colonies up to this point anti-Semitism starts to rise that is attacks on Jews that in Europe wh kicked the Moors out of their country and took it back under their controlen Spain and Portugal the Moors were in Islamic empire that had control of Spain and Portugal for a couple centuries anyway when they kicked him out they then got permission from the pope to launch an inquisition to purge out all the last remaining influence of those people in Spain and they will stage what becomes now famous the Spanish Inquinsition. it was an\u00a0 attack on all of those lingering Moorish ties to control and structure in Spain and they're trying to eradicate it so they persecute anything Muslim well then they pretty much extend that to anything that is not specifically Christian that is Catholic and with it they are incorporating attacks on Jews the Spanish Jews don't really have many options they want to get out of Spain or they could be killed they look at England England doesn't want them they look at France France doesn't want them they look all over the place for places where they can safely go there aren't any except for one. There are those English colonies on the other side of the ocean that if they can get there they probably can fly under the radar for a long time without anybody really realizing who they are what they stand for the fact that they're Jews and so they managed to get over to the American colonies in some limited amounts their ancestors by the time this is rolling around understand that the migration was early on in colonization and they've been there for a while now the Jews have been there for several Generations their families are part of the society over there just as everybody else's and all of a sudden they start being persecuted and this is really the first time you see widespread anti-jewish persecution rising up in the in the colony so anti-semitism creeps up into this. Religious attacks are widespread and the reason why this becomes significant keep in mind the context of when this is happening this is all happening after 1740 what happens in the 1770s anyone nobody yes we didn't pay attention in high school how about in grade school did you pay attention then what happens in 1776? Yeah the Declaration of Independence the American Revolution is going to happen then yeah easy to forget about that right so from since you have religious religious differences tearing American colonial society apart in a whole bunch of different ways you have internal political divisions in all of the colonies and you have different colonies that are actually fighting with each other as well all of these divisions all of these differences are creating riffs that it is not easy to overcome and ultimately Benjamin Franklin with his famous diagram of the snake cut into pieces Join or Die he's essentially saying we have to put aside all of those divisions all of those differences things that make us unique as colonies and as individuals and we have to come together in common purpose so this religious absurge becomes an impediment to creating that Unity that will be necessary to push off Britain it's going to be something that they will have to deal with and that is not an easy thing to overcome so we have the revolution and they start putting together a new country and they have to decide what they're going to do about religion. They remember the religious upheaval and all the differences the different groups fighting with each other and they know it's going to be a problem but Jefferson is really the one who pushes the central idea here we need to make sure that no religion is pushed officially by the US government it's the only way to stay insulated from it all also Jefferson has a distinct reason for this as a reaction to all of these things going on religiously there's an upsurge in what became known as enlightened Christianity that is trying to reconcile the differences between Enlightenment ideas and Enlightenment thinkers scientists who have been challenging religious doctrines of the church and this Rising tension between religion and secular minded approaches to society so people are saying you know these Enlightenment ideas can coexist with religion it's possible to bring them together and have them exist harmoniously so they start pushing ideas like rational Christianity well a lot of the Christian groups don't really like it when people come in trying to trying to shoehorn their beliefs and their faith system into modern political and scientific ideas to see if they can kind of mess up yet there's a lot of people who are trying to find that middle ground especially scientists who are saying: we're interested in how the world works but that doesn't mean that we're not religious Isaac Newton was a devout Christian and he did not want to somehow have his ideas used to prove that religion isn't accurate as a matter of fact he went out of his way to try to show that Christianity could coexist with scientific ideas that the ideas he was bringing for about how the world worked How the Universe worked there was no conflict and he's not the only one John Locke put out about life liberty and property as the natural rights that all humans have I mean we even quote him and his phraseology in the Constitution the Fifth Amendment no person can be denied of life liberty or property without due process of law that's straight out of law John Locke was also concerned about this battle between Enlightenment and religion and he put out an essay saying it was entitled The reasonableness of Christianity trying to show that Christianity is reasonable it is rational logical. There's nothing about it that is unscientific unmodern he's saying it is reasonable to be Christian and be a thinker being a scholar being a scientist so all of this is coming to a head when America is coming to grips with how do we deal with religion Thomas Jefferson was one of the key people who was one of the big formers of the American government we all know this right he wrote the Declaration of Independence. He was talking extensively with James Madison as the as the Constitution was being drawn up. James Madison was the main author of the Constitution but Jefferson's right there talking about these ideas as Madison's writing him down so he had huge influence over what America will be. Jefferson was not a Christian. He was a follower of a particular religious approach called deism it was one of these Enlightenment influenced religious movements during this. Of time and it's something that he was not alone in it Benjamin Franklin was also a deist and he was also very influential in the formation of the American government that was to come. What is a deist? Anybody know what it is? Nobody never heard of it? Okay. Deism is basically a religion where you believe in a higher power you believe that there is this all-powerful deity out there that created the entire universe. But at the same time assuming that that God is going to have a personal relationship with each and every person is the height of arrogance and hubris on humanities part to assume that you can have a personal relationship with God is like assuming that an ant looking up at you can have a personal relationship with you they put it on the same basic level. so while God created the universe created the earth created us. The whole system is set to moving and here we come and now it's our job to run it God's not doing God things we are the ones here and so ultimately is our job to keep things running this is a really convenient religion you believe in a higher power but there's no active responsibility it shapes your world view but you don't go to church you don't have to you can pray if you want to but chances are you're not going to bother because he's not going to be listening anyway. See what I mean? So Jefferson is a deist and a lot of people considered him a religious heritic. A lot of the religiously minded people respected Jefferson's ideas about government but at the same time look down upon his personal choices because he was somebody who was immoral and he was a blasphemer he was putting out these false religious ideas so they condemn them for those also he tended to like the Finer Things and he tended to have sex with a lot of his female slaves especially one in particular who really was more of a mistress to him than just a slave that he was trying to breed with so he took a lot of abuse for that. But Jefferson was able to get put in this idea of separation of church and state specifically that the United States would not have one specific religion that was the official religion Bane had an official religion England had an official religion France had an official religion America was not going to do it as a matter of fact he wanted to put a provision when they were coming up with the Bill of Rights to protect people from any government in interference in their freedom to practice whatever kind of religion they chose freedom of religious expression. That was straight out of Jefferson. Does that mean that the United States in its early formative years was unaffected by religion? course not. most people who are American are Protestants. Some of these religious ideas get tied very romantically into the creation of America and looking at it's Destiny. The American Destiny they say it has a manifest destiny. you heard that phrase before manifest destiny? The basically God has given given the United States this unique chosen privileged position of being the poor thinking, front running, Godly country. And it is our destiny and our duty to spread the\u00a0 so it is an expansionist ideology and not only does it use religion to justify expanding it uses religion to demand expanding that is their duty to ense so Manifest Destiny is pushing people that is what Manifest Destiny really locks into place but at the same time you have these competing Calvinists versus non-calvinist ideas out there as well now if I were to say Manifest Destiny is this calvinist or non calvinist? Do you remember what constituted Calvinism and what constituted non Calvinism? Who is Calvin's big rival intellectually anyone you guys don't remember what we covered a week ago huh? Calvin believed in this free Destiny yes predestination that everything has already been decided there is a destiny and we have no choice we have only the illusion of choice but our position here is to act out God's plan to carry out his will that's Calvin everything has been predetermined. Now if I say Manifest Destiny does that sound like him yep you hear that Destiny we have a destiny we we have this Mission by God yeah that's that's Calvin whereas Luther was saying people have freedom of choice. God gave you the right to choose your path and what you choose is up to you. So this is more out of Calvin's mindset but there's a lot of people who follow Luther's idea and there's a lot of people who don't really want a religious bend on the national thought, so they take it different look at things is this Venture that we're on is this America embracing its destiny or is it a competing vision? The grand experiment. Notice it being put in terms of science. The enlightenment secularism Americans on this Grand experiment we're trying something new it may succeed it may not we don't know until we do it. we're gonna tru and if something we try doesn't work we'll adjust it and if we succeed great if we don't hey we give it a shot. It's an experiment. This is more of a secular approach as opposed to this is America's Destiny a religious approach. So even the early visions of America are tied into this competing Vision between the religious and the secular. America goes through a big transformation Society goes through a major transformation there's a lot of social upheaval there's a lot of people saying we'll have had a class structures work. There are political shifts going on there are religious shifts going on there's all sorts of up people as people are adjusting to their new country. they're figuring out how things work. well one thing that happens is the people realize that what they really want, what America is defined by is not what they believe, It's what they want. And what do Americans want? Stuff. All kinds of stuff we call this Quest for Stuff consumerism we are consumers. Our job is to consume. How many of you have purchased something online in the last week my hands up? yeah, how many have not? Liars. if I were to say the last two weeks more hands would probably drop if I were to say the last month almost everybody's hands would drop we do business online. As a matter of fact that's one thing that makes cell phones so incredible there was a time when phones were simply for talking to people and then we started carrying them with us everywhere we went and they were still about talking to people but at a certain point somebody said well you know we can put internet functionality on this thing too. Oh that guy was Steve Jobs by the way you know who that is right? Yeah. Big shaper of your generation. But, during this period Of time, step and trying to figure out how things work and consumerism is really what is defining thing between Britain and France both pensions are rising with them we're trying to stay neutral and they keep pressuring us to pick a side ultimately a couple big embargoes embargoes are where you refuse to trade and it hurts Britain when we launch the embargoes against them, but it also hurts our need for stuff people start going from widthdrawl. Don't buy anything new for the next month see what happens. You're going to start getting twitchy real quick. There is a huge demand for consumer goods. And in order to meet that demand this is really that desperation during the embargoes is really what convinces America that they needed to industrialize. Industrial Revolution in this country. But when industrialization takes hold we get an a social transformation because of that the people who were middle class are starting to go out of business. more and\u00a0 that they were paying people in factories and most Americans don't want that it is brutally low what they're paying people it's clearly exploited but people who are desperate enough for taking those jobs. And because of that the middle class is shrinking. The working class is growing and the amount of money you have for Stuff is shrinking. Poverty is growing as a result of this change. Poverty brings with its social evils. What do I mean? What does poverty cause what comes out of poverty what are some of the social problems that grow out of poverty okay what's up wyou'll do it more crime yes crime rates Skyrocket people are getting desperate because they don't have enough money even to buy food. If you have a hungry kid believe me you're willing to do a lot to feed that kid so theft other forms of primer on the rise. Child labor yes that will become even more significant later but it does start to kick in a little bit what else? Social illness. The poverty creates if you are dead broke how do you feel? If you feel good? You feel bad so how do you cope with that? Alcohol alcohol consumption. Through the 1820s and 30s Rose to his highest point in American history ever. It's never been higher than that particular point. People drank alcohol all the time. They consumed and consumed huge quantities of alcohol. That was disturbing how much alcohol they were actually consumed. And it has an effect when you have people who are imbibing in alcohol on large scale let's take a person what happens when somebody gets drunk what are some of the problems that come out of that yeah? Okay. Domestic debut domestic abuse is a big one yeah big problem with the rising domestic abuse. Yes what else? Crime will rise because of it sure. Alcohol will cause people to make stupid decisions and do things that if they were sober they may not be willing to do but drunk they'll do them they lose their inhibitions and they they go ahead and do those things sure. There's all sorts of problems that can come out of this but alcohol is a big one. Domestic abuse. Family abandonment becomes big it was really hard for women to make a living. But, if men are feeling so disempowered that when they are working they're not making enough money to support their family, that gets to a lot of people to the point where they just say f it and they abandon their wife kids and take off. the wife Trying to raise those kids on her own that's not easy especially in a day where women being able to go out and get a job that's just not really something that is socially possible at this particular point in time. It's not like today if women want a job today they can get hired easily but back then there was a stigma against hiring women. Women were not seen as the ones who are supposed to be working men are supposed to work. So there's a lot of problems. There's also the problems of how to cope in other ways for example if a man gets off of work, and he's having a hard time paying the bills he's doing the best he can and he comes home and the wife is constantly harping at him, he might have been in him abandon her he might start drinking, or he might do other things look for companionship elsewhere so you see a rise in adultery. Lots of extra marital Affairs you also see a big rise in prostitution. So there's all sorts of different things that are playing into this and everybody said look at the social and moral degradation of America and they are coming up with all sorts of reasons that they point to but the religiously minded people who have been trying to get people's attention for a while say this is God's judgment. And they have a lot of people that they point at. As causing this very few of them actually get it right, but they're pointing at certain things and they said you know what maybe if we were to try to fix some of these things we can do it. And during this period of time you see another big religious upsurge. Here's a constant throughout history when times are hard you're going to see religious activity pick up. People will be looking for comfort in one way or another. Looking for support in one way or another and a lot of people turn to religion for those reasons. So if they kind of strayed from religious activity or they weren't religious to begin with they might get religion because of this. This leads to a period of religious up search that we call the second great awakening. basically the 1820s to the 1840 that period of time and there are some things about it that come out it is a very optimistic approach people are hopeful that they can improve things they are telling people hey religion can help us fix our country and help you fix yourself. It is optimistic it is also saying we can help improve society and ultimately move toward perfecting Society what do we call a perfect Society? Utopia. So utopianism is kind of wrapped into this idea as well so the Second Great Awakening is building an optimism. It's building on hope that you can improve things and perfect things. People are perfectible Society is perfectible. It's also encouraging people to be free thinkers saying, we are appealing to your reason so religiously rather than saying oh you're bad for doing this they say no there is a good reason to do this. And they start explaining the reasons not just the religious view point. And that becomes very successful for example in combating alcohol they start a number of movements that become known as: the temperance movement. A lot of different organizations for them and join this growing temperance movement what is temperance? What is temperance addressing anybody heard of the temperance movement? Or know what it is? Nobody? Okay. The temperance movement is a reform movement meant to either reduce the consumption of alcohol or outlaw alcohol altogether at this particular point in time they're not looking to outline instead they're relying on people's rationality to realize that alcohol is harming them and their families, and they are encouraging people to Simply drink in moderation, cut that, don't drink as much. Are they successful at this? yeah. Over a 10-year period from night from 1830 to 1840 that that period of time, alcohol consumption in America goes down 65%. People are drinking two thirds less alcohol as a nation than they were before. 2/3s that is a huge decline. The temperance movement later that we'll talk about the one at the early 20th century that introduces the period that we call prohibition you know what happens the first year? goes up 20%. They outlaw it and consumption of alcohol goes up 20% nationally. Overnight. which way maybe works better trying to Ram it down people's throats or appealing to their reasonableness and try to explain to them why it's a good idea to cut back? One approach works. one approach clearly did not. Another big thing that kind of gets tied into this is a lot of people are pointing at the social and moral degradation of Americans saying this is God's punishment to a country that tolerates and justifies enslaving people so it becomes part of the Abolitionist Movement.\u00a0a lot of people religiously join the Abolitionist Movement during this period of time the 1830s especially see a massive up search in people who are religious criminals too. and let's start really looking at who should be locked up in the big prisons and who should not so prison reform is being called for. There's also a lot of new denominations new Splinter groups as people start exploring religious ideas and expanding on them and part of this is with the big upsurge in religious revivals. religious revivals are similar to George Whitfield when he was traveling America he would go to one place and hold a series of meetings for about a week. And during that period of time people came every day to hear and they would get rejuvenated in their religious beliefs they get fired up and they need to move on to another location and hold another Revival well the revivals heat up in a big way during this period of time that's part of what makes the Second Great Awakening so significant. is the massive amount of these revivals that are encouraging people to get fired up about their religion and do something about the social problems of America in the process. So the religious preachers the religious leaders who are holding these revivals become very significant people. There are three I'm going to talk about. The first one we've already kind of talked about a little bit in the race section of the class and this is a guy named Lyman Beecher. Lyman Beecher is from the Northeast. He is one of those people who believes that slavery is a sin against God. So he is very much in line with the Abolitionist mindset but his big thing is saying you know why we have all the social ills and problems why we're being judged by God? It's because we are allowing all of these Catholics to come in and disrupt our great country. Catholics are agents of the Antichrist and they are trying to destroy everything good about our country. He points at Catholics and saying they are the root of all evil they are the problem. And we should be kicking Catholics out getting rid of them from this country they're not real Americans they are bringing us down and God's judgment is upon us because we allow them to come in. So his big thing is anti-Catholics\u00a0he also spends a great deal of time. Criticizing the sinful pastimes of the poor and saying if they stop doing these things Society will get better too he takes on gambling. who gambles? When you take a look at people who are down buying lottery tickets, do you see a lot of wealthy people buying lottery tickets? No usually it's the working steps that do. It's the poor segment who are doing the most gambling and the reason? They call it home run effect. If I can just make one big score I can take care of problems for a while if I can just hit that lottery number my problems are solved. All of my economic problems go away. This is not a New Concept this has been around for a while looking for ways to connect with that money that free fall and if they can get lucky at the table maybe they can bring home a little bit more cash do they? Not usually. Usually gamblers lose money. So gambling drinking whoring. All of those things are things that feature attacks. And I said we mentioned it before let's talk about how we mentioned it do you remember when we were talking about the Irish immigrants and how they were moving into public service jobs like Police and Fire Fire Department officials and whatnot? Well that was this guy this is Peter's Church they let his church burn down. However beecher have a significant impact not only on the revivals he holds he starts embracing some limited emotionalism he wants to keep it in check he sees a lot of danger with too much emotion but he thinks that a little emotion can be good to help stimulate religious activity so he's advocating within measure with some emotionalism being included. It is in fact his daughter who ends up becoming even more famous than he was and he was fairly well known and popular. But his daughter was named Harriet Beecher Stowe. Anybody heard of her? Uncle Tom's Cabin is one of the pieces of American literature that is famous because it is ultimately one of the biggest abolitionist novels ever written and she was significant enough that eventually she will meet Abraham Lincoln as a visitor to the White House. And he greets her by saying so you're the little lady who started this conflict. ouch. Abraham Lincoln just put the cause of the Civil War at her feet now he said it jokingly, but there's a certain amount of truth to it. She caused a massive upsurge in people standing up to slavery. People say you know what, she's right. This book that she writes is powerful. And she is really contributing to that Abolitionist Movement in a big way. Her book becomes the biggest selling book in America other than the Holy Bible. That's the only book printed that has better sales than her book that tells you how significant her book was at the time too. You heard of somebody being referred to as an Uncle Tom? Okay another preacher who makes a big impact is a man named Charles Finney. Charles Finney was to an extent one of the people who learned from Beecher and he starts holding revivals as well but unlike feature he believes that emotionalism is key\u00a0to a good Revival\u00a0he wants to encourage emotionalism and that bothers beer will frequently. He's encouraging the open active participation of women in the Revival now feature includes women women are welcome at the revivals but as far as participation publicly, the belief in America is generally speaking men are public figures women are private figures.</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%208/1460%20Mar%2013/","title":"Transcription","text":"<p>And zero okay yeah it's it's more like the you're probably seeing the score off of the exam and for some reason you're seeing the previous score rather than the curved score and you're only supposed to see the curb score you know so that you don't get this kind of confusion so I'm going to have to look and see what's causing this and see if I can fix it I haven't typically had that problem but yeah the grades were curbed this week and if you're seeing your end score as being zero on average that's definitely something I need to take a look at make sure we get it fixed okay but yes the Great okay so when we were talking last time about the second right away we've been talking about Limon Beecher and he had a little bit more conservative approach he was starting to allow some emotion in and encourage people to get excited about their religion but he kept it limited he didn't want things getting too emotional and he became a big critic of Charles Finney who was in a way kind of one of the people who was inspired by Beecher and grew out of that experiential approach the religion and Vinny will Embrace emotionalism and encourage it he will turn it loose and so emotionalism is becoming much more part of what's going on at this point in time also people had social reasons to want this emotional release the times during this early 1800s in America were tough this was a time of the first Industrial Revolution a lot of people's lives were changing they were in flux some people found themselves out of work if that happened what did they do to try to feed their families you know what could they what could they do in response to those hard times and so this constant life of anxiety of feeling like your life is always on the edge of failure that will drive people to drink that'll drive people to look for escapism though it'll drive some people to cry and so they have to start looking at the problems as saying hey what's wrong with America is a social construct we need to fix it and there's this belief that America is fixable and it begins with the individual it's this concept of perfectionism perfectibility people are perfectible and really through Charles Finney you really hear that language come out in his speaking he is big on pushing this idea of you can perfect yourself and buy it you can a perfect union I mean notice that it's even referring to some of the language of the hope of the founders of the Constitution this is right in the wording of the constitution in order to form a more perfect union well that's what they're trying to do they're embracing some of that revolutionary pervert from earlier in there their lives and they see the problems and they're trying to fix them standpoint and religious motivations but this reform that starts out in this period of time to challenge some of the problems that have risen up those are real concerns and people are trying to take a firm hand in the correction of the social bills now keep in mind that part of what's the problem is the revolution itself some people revolted from high means high and mighty ideals the standards and language of the Revolution you guys have heard it why did the American Revolution happen what were they protesting what was the basis of the revolution no taxation without representation yes that was the big catch phrase of the American Revolution we demand representation a voice in our own governing and for the people at the bottom they heard the no taxation part they didn't care about the rest and when they succeeded what they learned was hey with mass Insurrection we can force the government off our backs permanently and we can live however we want so with this is a certain underlying mental Anarchy that's going on a lot of people resent any kind of government control over their life and these people are problem in society that's part of the underpinnings of the chaos that's emerging this lower underbelly of society is getting a little bit more forward because anytime the American government now tries to put controls on the people and so the 1800s that first decade of the 1800s under Thomas Jefferson he started seeing riots break out everywhere civil violence is breaking out all over the place and by the 1820s and 30s people are said okay this needs to stop we need to identify what the problem is and fix it and so religious reform is created out of this temperance people were consuming alcohol in never before and never since seen quantity the average Americans started drinking as soon as they got up and went to bed they had a glass of whiskey next to the bed when they went to bed and as soon as they got up they started drinking again and that's not just men men women even children were drinking alcohol all day and it's not like a drink or two or getting a little tipsy no they were consuming staggering amounts of alcohol what would normally put you on your butt would have just kept them functional okay you guys consume a fifth of whiskey in a day you're going to be plastered you're probably going to go pass out and wake up with a hangover besides of Texas well back then drinking that much on a daily basis was routine throughout the day they drank that much everyone kids might have drank a little less but drinking in huge quantities who's coming and this became one of the biggest reforms that they wanted to address let's get people to cut back on drinking they know they're not going to get alcohol outlaw and they're not even trying to do that they're just trying to convince people hey look what you're doing and look what it's doing to you cut back on the booze drink in more moderation temper your use of alcohol that's why it becomes known as the temperance movement so alcohol was big enough also are trying to convince poor people who are wasting their money on alcohol and gambling and prostitutes saying hey why don't you spend your money a little more constructively so Thrift became a big cause spend your money on what you need quit buying what you immediately feel you need to cope with with things instead instead of picking up a bottle of booze with your money why don't you take some food home feed your family with that money instead and so spend your money correctly spend your money wisely Thrift became a big movement another big push that was especially strong in New England was education education that is supported publicly now as good new Republican Society had to figure out how to be Republicans it had never really been done before and they were going into whole new territory they realize that they need a population of civic-minded people who had the proper education and knew what being Republican meant as far as everybody knew up to this point the only experience I had was operating in a monarchy they didn't know what being a republican meant well it meant that they need schools and so New England especially was pushing heavy for schools publicly funded schools the South however was very resistant to this the reason is the way schools are funded How are schools funded taxes what kind of taxes property taxes property taxes is really the reason up in New England people have the property ownership spread out over many more people okay you don't see one particular group of people in society that have to put the bill for everybody it's pretty evenly distributed so they're willing to take that on it's more equal more utilitarian among their society to put in into action the burden is spread nice and evenly down on the south that wouldn't be the case if it's funded by property taxes it means the slave owners the ones with the massive plantations they are the ones who are putting the bill for everyone else they own most of the land in the South they might be the top one to one and a half percent but they own 90% of the land and that means 90% of the tax bill will fall on them and they're saying now wait a minute I'm not going to spend all of my hard-earned money so that a bunch of work with people of masses can go get educated if they want education let him get it themselves and so there was resistance the attitudes about education took hold and they became part of the local character of people in those parts of the country today the best gun best schools in the country are up in New England this is still true they have the best schools with the best test scores up there in New England you take a look at the worst Deep South and so those patterns still are with us even though slavery is long gone the patterns for education and distribute of the funds for Education the willingness to publicly support it just isn't there as much in the south a religious Quest it was your religious duty to be clean they figured if Society was perfectible and the individual is perfectible first if you want to clean somebody's mind they need to have a clean body the Japanese were bathing every day or at least every two days and they had been for centuries but in the western world most of Europe is still on that one month cycle well it's the last day of the month I guess I better pay that kind of thing and so Europe's fascination with America they see America as a bizarre place obsessed with bodily cleanliness and everything about what they do is connected with time they have a new phrase in America time is money everything is done if you are wasting time you're wasting the potential to make money and this is also put into religious terms if you are wasting time you are wasting God's time and God wants you to be productive God wants you to do something with your life if you're out to self improve yourself and Society and the nation you have to be somebody who's willing to work put in that time don't waste it and time Obsession became something of almost a pseudo religion in America in and of itself time is money this obsession with time was radiated throughout American society Frenchman Alexis de tocqueville wrote a very famous book called a democracy in America he came over during this period of time and studied Americans watch them look that they went through their new experiments in Republican democracy and he was baffled and fascinated by what he saw he's talking about this because this is this is encroaching into an area that no country has done as far as they can tell ever not like this America is a unique place they have unique customs that are emerging out of this new Republican mindset and one of those is the serious obsession with time everything they do has to be efficient they have to save time wherever they can eating he comments on how Americans eat really fast if they sit around the table they don't sit around talking about their their day and enjoying the social interaction over a meal the way dining traditionally has been done instead they sit there have the food in front of them and scarf it down as fast as they can and then boom they're off doing other things Alexis de tocville was the name of this guy and the book was Democracy in America if you have not read the topville or even part of the Tokyo's book before you get out of college somebody screwed up you should read part of that book if not the entire book before you get out of college that is one of the great pieces of social history of the 19th century so time obsession America also became very committed to Accurate clocks if you're going to turn obsession over time up to this level you're going to want to be able to measure it accurately right after all if you can measure the time accurately you know exactly how much money you're going to make so all of this is part of American culture but it also has some Reflection from the religious activism in this period of time but the religious activism is also a response to the tensions that people feel about this if people are always obsessed over time inefficiency they're always learn should I be doing this should I be doing this year I'd be doing this they are so tightly wound they need an outlet for that in that outlet has been booze revivals offer them a new outlet religious they offer them a religious output revivals while they focus on some of these areas of society they also focus on the home quit cheating on your spouse stay loyal don't abandon your family family devotion piety that kind of thing these other social causes all blend into this belief that there is a religious reason to improve that something has gone wrong in God's plan and we need to put it right that's why things are messed up they have religious reasons to fix it part of this is an outgrowth of manifest destiny they have a desire to civilize the savagery of the West to spread their idea of civilization into this Savage world and what they've come to realize is the Savage re is converting the Civilized people into one civilized people more and faster than the opposite can make happen that civilized people can transform the savagery it's creating more Savages essential and so part of what they want to do is take a more religious and moral minded people West and so part of that Western movement that will occur larger large amounts of it are going to be heavily religiously driven to where they're trying to take religion with them they're not just transporting Humanity out west they're transporting religion and the social cultural beliefs that Americans hold valuable so that becomes part of this whole manifest destiny if you're not taking the religious ideas with it what's the point there's no point to go in West if you're not expanding that with it because of the religious activism and the heavy emotional content a lot of people come to really like the more emotional approach to practicing religion and in this you see a new group rise the previously has been fairly small but is growing larger and larger throughout the Evangelical movement of the Second Great Awakening and that is the rise of a group called the best now after this point Presbyterians and methodists are the two big denominations in America along with congregationalists methodists are a little bit more liberal and tolerance of emotionalism Vinny for example is a Methodist but with the Baptist they're fully embracing the emotional and they see it as their primary duty to convert the unconverted that the reason America is having the problems is because there's so many Godless people out there so they need to get people Godly again it's their job to go out and convert people so missionary activities religious conversion become the driving force behind Baptists and that remains True to this day Baptists are still heavily focused on converting and fixing what's wrong the revivals are an outgrowth of these various concerns where religious groups and leaders put out these one week or two week sessions where people hold regular meetings and get fired up over that period of time and then the Revival moves on to a new location that's how they work and the people running these revivals became known as evangelist just as George Whitefield was kind of the first big evangelist others will follow his pattern the Baptists are going to get really active holding me but the Presbyterians will still hold them sometimes and the Methodist will hold him a little bit more actively than the Presbyterian but really the Methodist and especially the Baptist are going to be the ones heavily holding Revival today most of the revivals that are still active in America and there are still revivals being run are by the past they're the ones running typically that's where you see a lot of these Revival activities still today why do revivals have so much appeal and it does not matter what class you're in you're feeling it Working Class People are dealing with the bills of poverty they're dealing with hopelessness they're dealing with the need to have some kind of purpose in life something to give them directions something they can restore their faith in their future Revival software that whenever things are hard people will often turn to religion as a way to cope with that difficulty that is a standard not just Christianity but you get outside of the Christian World non-christians other religions work the same way in their own areas as well wherever you see things get hard people will have an upstairs of religious activities it happens here too so the poor are looking for ways to cope they're looking for hope they're looking for help in many cases revivals can help offer that for the middle class they are so tightly wound they need to uncork okay and revivals are a pressure valve they give them that pressure release in a healthy way not a destructive way instead of going home and picking up the bottle they go and get active religiously and even after the Revival is gone they continue that religious activity and at least once a week they get to uncork they are more responding to these religious ideas if you are religiously active it means that you are trying to fix yourself trying to improve yourself and that's positive because if you're improving yourself you're going to improve your business your entire way of life will benefit from that so essentially going to church is showing a desire for the middle class to get ahead and so even if they don't take it completely to Heart they will still go and they will still be active because being active shows that they want to be upwardly mobile but it does give a lot of people in the middle class who are looking out at America saying what's wrong with this place we need to fix it it gives them an outlet to do exactly that other people who are similarly minded come together in these revivals and they say hey let's talk about creating something to come back alcohol let's talk about something that we can do about getting people to spend their money wisely and they come up with these ideas that are personally resonant to them and get involved with other people who are that way in the revivals provide a foundation for that to happen so the middle class driven reform movements of this period of time are also something fed by the revivals women we talked about women especially responding to the revivals in a big way two to one women outnumbered revivals at Finney's and while his was still slightly higher than the rest women greatly outnumber men at all of the revivals there are a number of reasons for this first of all why are there fewer men at the revivals what do you think do women have jobs no most women are not employed it is socially unacceptable a lot of people will not hire women on principle women are supposed to be people of the home domestic they are supposed to take care of the kids in the house they're supposed to be the nurturers of the family they are not supposed to be working that's what the men are supposed to do so if they're holding revivals during the day who has time to go women do they're not going to work some men get permission to go to work permission to get off work to go to these other people are out of work completely and they've got no restriction whatsoever they can go if they want so part of it is the availability more women are available to go but women are getting a lot from the revivals this is an important thing here for the women they're facing a lot of challenges a lot of changing in society is going on women are getting more vocal about their rights it's slow but it's building and they're looking for ways to express that Revival start getting giving them an outlet and people like Finney starting encouraging them to take that outlet hey go ahead get up in front and talk give it a try you don't say anything that's what you're doing now and so he encourages this is feeding into this desire of women to start taking on more civic responsibility but also the decline of arranged marriages a lot of women young people in general rebel against their parents during this early Republic and wanted to pick their own mates rather than fight them on it they their parents basically said okay well let's go ahead and allow it the problem is women came to realize that arranged marriages mean safety usually the parents had a vested interest in choosing a stable partner somebody who is good for their kids that's not always the case but it usually is and as a result arranged marriages tend to provide a woman with more stability into the future but now that they are falling out of favor women have to find their own matches and they're not quite sure how to go about that especially since so many men are also looking West oh I'm going to go make my life out in the west will take me with you I'd love to go no no no that's not something a woman should have to do go back and I'll get a wipe when all the hard stuff is done and we can start building a life together that kind of thing and the women are standing there watching the men leave and most of the men who are leaving are the perfect marriageable age young men who have the energy the strength the endurance to deal with setting up a new life somewhere else this is not an easy thing to do the women are getting left behind and they're going man people we have to choose from it's getting Slim Pickens they want to expand their social networks well revivals do that revivals get them out of only their own little community and start connecting multiple churches from wider areas and bringing all those people in together and as they do those people begin interacting and the women get a lot more opportunity to meet men so you're big for women another group that they were big Forest slaves slaves find themselves getting included in a lot of the religious activities in fact a lot of people include anti-slavery as one of the big reforms that they want to bring about in America a lot of people thought that slavery was on its way out with the Revolution and in fact many states even while the Revolution was going on we're starting to say let's set the stage for phasing slavery out in the revolutionary period while the war was still technically on Vermont free their slaves Pennsylvania will free their slaves in 1780 the ending of the Revolutionary War was 1783 so that was pre-revolution and so a lot of places are looking at hey let's go into this embracing and so you start seeing more and more States especially in the north pushing that idea some places in the Deep South they're more resisted to that and this anti-slavery movement because it doesn't take hold but actually slavery expands and gets even bigger than it was before a lot of people are saying this is why America so screwed up and we need to deal with the main problem freeing the slaves so there are people who want to end slavery a lot of the slaves are religious that doesn't necessarily mean the slaves are Christian although most of them are most of the slaves are either Methodist or Baptist maybe this is an acceptable one because after all if they're not looking for their freedom now but looking for it in the afterlife they're less likely to revolt does that make sense absolutely it makes sense so where does that lead to a lot of slaves will start looking to their own for leadership but remember what I said earlier in the in the Race part where the black slaves who rise up and start becoming the leaders of these churches what's the problem with them they know how to read and the master did not groom them for a leadership they're not like the slave drivers who are treated as special better different they are treated but they can read their literate that makes them dangerous and in fact the worst flavor bolt in the United States period was led by a slave preacher and his name was Nat Turner Nat Turner was reading the Bible from cover to cover it took him some time he wasn't that good but keep in mind being literate does not mean you are educated it just means you have the ability to read not that you have the ability to fully understand what it is you're reading and that was the problem with that Turner he got to a particular point in the Bible and it was frankly a book that slave owners would probably not want slaves to read but there's one book of the Bible that you don't want your slave to read what would that book be what's that Revelation no they probably wouldn't be able to understand that it sounds like somebody who's what else Exodus exactly Exodus is all about how the nation of Israel was enslaved by the Egyptians Moses rose up led a massive slave Insurrection and led the people out of Egypt to the promised land where they established a nude Town Jerusalem to be the holy area and that Turner was reading this thing he says I know where Jerusalem is that's the answer and he says Jerusalem that's just a few miles down the road Jerusalem Virginia you didn't know it wasn't the real dream there are lies the real problem remember when I said education is not inherent in being literate he thought the real Jerusalem was the one just down the road so he convinced his people that he was speaking for God that he was chosen to leave them out of bondage and he led them on a journey down the road was he right no the lights heard about the big wave of violence the massive slave Uprising there was led by a black preacher a slave preacher a slave who is literate and their worst fears were made manifests when southern slave owners go to sleep at night and have nightmares what is it they dream about slaves rising up and hacking their families to pieces that's what terrifies them that is the Boogeyman under the bed so to speak and then they hear about Nat Turner and what's worse is they didn't capture turn he and several others were still on the loose they ran out into the swamps of Virginia were hiding out now they were on the Run but people in the South thought it was a really good time to visit friends up in New York and so you'll see basically a mass Exodus of slave owners is they go visit Northern friends for a while until people get control of Nat Turner and once they do capture not turn they hold a big big public trial stop it the slave owners got brutal and part of this will feed the rising Abolitionist Movement as well keep in mind that this is going to horrify a lot of people in America what they do to Nat Turner they want to set an example so they have a force of a trial where all the slaves in the area are brought in to watch it Turner is put on trial he is condemned to be executed if that were simply hanging him that wouldn't be that big of a deal but they want to make a point they start with playing is where they peel your skin off while you're still alive to enjoy it and then they've been affect you where they pull out your internal organs and play with them while you get to watch hey what's this for do you think he needs it I don't know not sure and they will start pulling the various pieces out and have a conversation with the person hey do you think you need this I don't think you do maybe we can put this one aside what do you think hey does this hurt oh yeah I guess it does that kind of stuff and then still not done big drawn quartering that's where they tie all of your arms and legs to an individual horse they shoot the horse out horses out in four different directions and it rips your arms and legs completely off your body and only the Torso remains and finally they decide okay let's end it for good and they beheaded are they done no they're still not done they take him to six different places every part of them that's left he's in six pieces now the Torso the head and four limbs six and all of those pieces is buried in a different place and every place they're buried they run horses over the top of it so that no one person knows where all of his pieces remain they have condemned him to the worst form of death that they could possibly imagine this was brutal and a lot of people in the north are going whoa it's one thing to execute him what to do that that's just wrong we need to do something about slavery in this country and so for a lot of people this will be an Impulse to rise into the anti-slavery movement to become an abolitionist somebody who will fight against it religious reasons some slaves also who are religious will reject Christianity and instead they will try to practice their Africanized religions from back home but slave importation was really declining and by the 1820s there weren't a lot of slaves getting brought in anymore they outlawed the slave importation trade from Africa but America already had enough slaves in place to where they could perpetuate the next generation of slaves and so a lot of the slaves were second third fourth generation well how do you perpetuate a religious tradition that you had no part in ever practicing in person you go off of what you were told by your parents your grandparents maybe your great-grandparents and what they tell you is what you learn so they're practicing it second hand at best for the most part which means it's going to have gas and the religious practice can't have gaps they need to fill those gaps in they need to have something to do for those and so they fill it in with things that they know what do they know Christianity they may not believe Christianity but some of the things that they fill those gaps with are out of Christian ideology what you end up getting is a weird mixture of African religious Traditions Christian religious Traditions combining and creating something new something different than both of them it is neither African nor Christian it is something else this is where Voodoo comes from this is where Santa Maria comes from Conjuring was another big one that rose up are referred to as synchronism that is the taking of bits and pieces of different religions rather than pulling people over to one side or the other they create essentially a third group somewhere in the middle that are distinct in and of themselves syncretism the practice of combining two different ideas from two different cultures into a third and religions are where you really saw this come to play one thing the slave communities are remembered for today and something that is still kind of kept alive and passed on is the knowledge of slave spirituals the songs that slaves sang in the field to express their religious desire for freedom in the afterlife Swing Low Sweet Chariot is probably the most famous of these but there are many and there are people who have tried to document and save those over time so there are repositories for you can find that but these slave spirituals became a way of expressing these feelings while they worked in the field but they also became forms of communication if people felt that there was something going on that everybody needed to know about they had signals to communicate some of those things by picking up certain songs for example if somebody on the plantation died they had a song that would let them know somebody was dead so that when they got off work and went home that night back to the slave quarters they would be ready for whatever news they were going to get and the way it would work is somebody who hurt it would start singing a certain song that was only song at those times and then others would start singing the song and it would pass on through the fields as they heard other people singing they would start singing it too that was how they passed some signals so it did become a way of communicating as well but it also showed the Deep religious commitment that a lot of the slaves felt to the religious up search during this period of time and the great this period of the second right Awakening this huge up surge of religious activism led a lot of the Baptist to really make an effort to convert slaves they felt that the slave Souls were as important as the non-slaved souls that they needed to convert both of them now I promised you to leaders to talk 3 l to talk about we've only talked about two so far Lyman Beecher was the first one we talked about and Charles Finney he was the second one we talked about let's talk about the third now he was a little different but also very influential part of what is underlying this period again is this idea of perfectionism I can perfect myself I can build a perfect community and I can build a perfect Society what do we call that Utopia yes utopianism there's an underlying utopianism in the in the Second Great Awakening that is permeating culture and society and it comes out with this third guy his name was Joseph Smith Jr Joseph Smith Jr was somebody who took a little concern with the overemotional practice of religion and he was really Disturbed with the problems of society he had a religious experience where he wrote down what he saw in his vision he believed God was speaking to him and he wrote that message down into a single piece of work it will eventually come to be known as The Book of Mormon a group of followers that will follow him are Mormons so this is the rise of Mormonism now at first it sounded like he was an offshoot of just very conservative Christianity he was concerned about too much emotion getting into the place of religion which a lot of people were but he said you know basically what's going on here the reason we're having so many problems all the changes we've made here in America are disrupting the Ancient Order of Things there is an ancient order that has been alive for thousands of years of how societies function no the Ancient Order of Things the man provides the food he goes out provides protection he works for providing for the family the mother raises the kids and takes care of the home he says that is the natural way of things and we're getting away from that those systems are being disrupted so we're going to put things right we need to restore he forms a religious commune in Illinois called Nauvoo Nauvoo now who was a settlement for people who were following his ideas and said yeah let's build a society where we can start really putting forward our ideas so they created a local town government within their community at one point he suggested that they own all property commonly communally and they all objected they said what do we look like Indians to you and he says no no that's okay we can still do this with individual ownership and they well okay we thought you were off your rocker there for a minute but now that Saturday is restored itself we can continue but they build this Society where religious ideas are controlling the social atmosphere and the regulations for that town what do we call that again theocracy good yes they set up a theocracy however pretty soon people get curious about this community and they start listening to Joseph Smith and they go wow that guy's nuts he's off his rocker we need to do something about this people will start getting more and more vocal against Smith and his followers and pretty soon people start dealing with abuse should we leave maybe we should leave and submit the same I don't know what's right it out they just are angry because they're not ready for this well one night and the second in command in the church was a guy by the name of Brigham Young and bring them young stands up and says okay that's it we've seen where this is leading and we're all going to follow him to the Grave if we don't leave now and so they all said yep you're absolutely right they pick up from Illinois and they start moving West they follow the Oregon Trail up to a point and then they Branch off on a rather obscure branch that will actually lead one famous group of Western migratory peoples into serious disaster if you guys heard of the daughters Donner Party they were a group of settlers who took this cut off called Hastings cut off and went across the Great Salt Flats of Utah and tried to go up into California over the Sierra Nevada when they got up in the Sierras it started snowing and it snowed them in for months they couldn't get out of the get out of that area many of them resorted to cannibalism to stay alive yeah ouch so they were basically going on the same roof only thing is they didn't go all the way to California he got to the Great Salt Lake and Brigham Young said this is it this is where we're going to sit this is where we're going to establish ourselves and a lot of people said what are you nuts this is a terrible place to locate we're next to a lake that is salty he says yeah but there's other fresh water sources we'll be fine yeah it's going to be hard to arrange ourselves in this Hospital environment others who are with them will say no no we're not going with this we're heading on we're going to continue the journey on to California like there's other sane people who are on the other Trail and so a lot of them will migrate and they will send her into Northern California keep them in mind when we get to the consumerism part because I'm going to talk about this winter group that broke off from the main group and went to California they're going to play a role meanwhile if you take a look at Utah today the state of Utah what is the number one religious group that is practicing religion in Utah today Mormons religious group in Utah so their presence is still felt there this permanent establishment they made really took hold and it's continuing to take hold Generations are perpetuating this over time okay there's one more group I want to look at with a rather unusual leader and they're more friends I don't include this leader as one of the big leaders of the Great Awakening but at the same time they're interesting enough as a group to talk about the reason is they were led by a woman and that in and of itself is worthy to talk about the woman's name was Ann Lee and Lee had arrived at a fairly young age in America in 1774 right as the revolution is getting ready to happen so she was here at the birth of this new country of the Revolution and forward and she also had a religious experience in her life much like Joseph Smith did where she believed that she was there it's still kind of Fringe and hanging on but it's hard to perpetuate why is it hard to perpetuate well at the core of this personal purification that they have to go through is the concept of celibacy celibacy they need to withstand from having sex she says sex was necessary in order to perpetuate the species but it also brought out Humanities base your side it encouraged the evil to set in and if we really want to clean up our country and we want to prepare for the next coming this next holy world existence then we need to instead abstain from sex it will keep up here and so the men slept in their own dormitories and the women slept in their own dormitory like you said you saw that but when they conducted business of the of the community they all did it together as a group everybody was equal this was the most egalitarian you probably saw American get during this period of time egalitarian means equal Society the most equality that America has ever really had up to this point could be seen with the Shakers they lived in separate Spears yes but when they came together during the day they were equal the men and women all had an equal voice and while they might have different roles none of their roles were seen as subservient to the other the women were not subservient to the men they were just as important just as significant just as public they were all responsible ownership was communal they owned all the property community they realized that if their society was going to survive they needed a source of income from the outside world to get things that they couldn't make themselves so they got into making furniture and as a group they put up a type of furniture that became very well known it was solid very clean lines very well built good quality craftsmanship that was what it was known for and it became known as the shaker style today if you go to furniture stores you can still find the shaker style of furniture being made even if it's not being made by shakers the Shakers are basically more or less extinct there's still a few who are practicing it but it was hard to perpetuate their numbers and while they reach a peak of roughly 6,000 in that community after 1850 it started a severe plummet and decline until they more or less died out why did they go into decline celibacy there's the problem how are religions perpetuated kids kids learn from their parents and the parents indoctrinate their kids in their religious beliefs and the kids follow what their parents have taught them well if they stop having kids where's the next Generation going to come from they weren't believing there was going to be another generation and the second coming that Ann Lee had prophesied did not actually come to pass nonetheless she still fits into this unusual model of the Second Great Awakening were people are turning to religious ideas trying to fix what's wrong with Society she offers a different approach very different from some perspective but it is still religiously driven and it's impacted and influenced by a lot of the other movements that are going on they are affecting each other Society does not live in a vacuum much as they might like to it places even the Shakers could not live completely in a vacuum they still had to have some contact with the outside world because they couldn't get everything they needed so they needed that so even they who shunned the outside world and focused in on their own community they weren't able to keep it all out that is where I am going to cut off I told you we'd end a little early today so I'm going to Turn You Loose just about 10 minutes early have fun I'll see you on

we're going to have to push the exam okay and part of that is we're still running a hair behind but we've made up most of the ground the bad news is when I draw up my syllabus I actually put the exam a week sooner than I should have in the schedule anyway so basically it's a week and a half earlier than it should be right now and so I'm going to push it back one week and we should be on track also in order to make up the time for those of you doing the extra credit assignment normally I show the movie in class and instead of showing it in class I'll give you a streaming link so you can watch it on your own and there's a benefit to that too I mean yes you have to watch it on your own rather than in here but the good news is if you kind of tuned out something and you have to go back looking for something you said oh what did that say again you can readjust it okay you can go back and and watch it over again or you know look at certain parts so having the ability to you know do your paper and then go wait a minute what about that you can go find it again so that's an extra advantage okay so we all clear on that yep one week I'll push it back a week so instead of having the exam as soon as you get done with spring break which means you would have had to study over spring break you can study if you want or wait until like most of you will the night before yes or even the day of oh man let's pick up where we left off where we left off was basically the end of the progressive air the nail in the coffin and progressivism was really the passage of the two constitutional amendments in 1920 the 18th and the 19th the 18th amendment was again prohibition outlawing alcohol the 19th amendment was women's suffrage and things were a little bit out of control morally socially in a lot of ways and some people see this is the last ditch effort to try to control it but they passed these with reservation the truth is even people who spoke out against the evils of alcohol had a bottle stashed in the back of their cupboard anyway so they drank they just didn't drink heavily or didn't drink in public but they still wanted their boots and the moral reformers were going yes we accomplished something and people are going yeah but then we really which is a big reason why the year after prohibition is passed alcohol consumption went up not down okay the other ones women suffrage and a lot of men were going you know we did this because we felt we needed to in order to control the morals of America the right to vote I mean today yeah absolutely but at the time it was still very much a man's world and women operated within that political and social structure so having women have the right to vote a lot of men they passed it but they're looking back going if we really do that I can't believe we did that why did we do that so with those last two being if not completely unpopular at least questionable people are going okay maybe we've changed enough for now let's let's stop changing plus there's a backlash against the rapid change and this is something that all societies have whenever there's a period of Rapid change whether it's in a liberal direction or a conservative Direction in other words having liberal changes expanding certain ideas as opposed to a conservative slam the brakes on and let's regress okay whatever your liberal or conservative country might be whenever you have period of change you're going to get pushed back there's going to be resistance and the Progressive Era there was a lot of change all in a very short time keep in mind that most of the legislation was passed within 10 years and in that 10-year period from 1910 to 1920 huge amount of legislation is passed also in this time something else to keep in mind what happened between 1914 and 18 anyone and World War 1 has a huge impact on the Progressive Era as well when the veterans were returning they were screwed up and they were almost all drinking very heavily to the point where people said maybe we have to pass prohibition just to get them to cut back on the drinking they saw the drinking of the Veterans as something they needed to stop also they saw the huge immorality the veterans ever all these soldiers while they were over in Europe they were in France and notice the connotation date what is associated with France well it's a place completely consumed with pleasure seeking in immorality all they did over there when they weren't fighting was drinking and whoring and now they're coming back and doing the same thing here see they're French we need to stop that and so the veterans become the target of a lot of reform in fact both of the constitutional amendments are aimed at them to a large extent the reason why people are desperate enough to try these is to try to react to everything they're seeing that is a problem with the veterans does the veterans are returning in 1919 1920 is one of those Constitutional Amendments go through they are connected so progressivism caused a certain amount of discontent but combined with the war there was mass disillusionment in America and it wasn't just America that was disillusioned Europe is disillusion too the war disillusioned Europe but America is also being disillusion not just by the war but by all of this social change that they're starting to question keep in mind the reforms that progressivism brought are very controlled and people feel like they're being squeezed by Society by the government everybody's in their business telling them what to do this is supposed to be the land of the free People don't feel quite so free unpopular policies during something that they do one of the few times in America that we actually have conscription and by conscription I mean a draft being drafted into the army or the Navy or whatever in the military drafts are not particularly something that is popular with people forcing people into the military requiring them to serve in uniform is something that America tries to avoid most of the time but in World War 1 they called up a draft that's unpopular especially in rural communities keep in mind in in the cities if you lose someone okay you have maybe somebody in the family who isn't providing an income for that family but they can make it up in other ways but for Farms the most able-bodied people on the farm are between 17 and 25 years of age what ages are you getting drafted into the military around the same period and so the most able-bodied Farm Workers are being pulled out of the farms and a time when the nation needs more food production in order to support a foreign war effort you see the problem farmers are really against the draft and then there's the war time provisions of the government the government says well we're running short on this this and this we have to start rationing rationing is understandable and the country sucks it up and does it they know why it needs to be done but at the same time that doesn't mean it's popular so when all of a sudden they get told well if you want to buy beef you can only buy it on these days in these areas and you have to have a ration coupon in order to do it and once you used your rations that's all you get that's all the beef you can buy this leads of course the black market for the ration coupons people will sell them money but it also does something else whenever a product has abundance scarcity in other words it's harder to get what happens to the price and more time cause massive inflation in a lot of prices not just food all sorts of things are skyrocketing so the cost of living is going up but incomes are not and enough people in America are having a hard time making it as it is without the prices going through the roof businesses had been the target of much of the legislation to reform America during this period of time so the business world was now dealing with something they've never had to deal with before Washington is telling them what they have to do rather than the other way around businesses were used to being in the driver's seat now that relationship has to some extent flipped and businesses resent the government telling them what they can and cannot do with their own business the land of the free has turned into the land of the controlled and oppressed and they start reacting to it this pushback is largely directed against the progressive changes they blame the reformers for a lot of this control and saying well while some of that was definitely necessary and they will definitely say well you know we we did accomplish a lot but maybe we went too far in some areas and so there's a pushback against all of the reform that happened in a creek tons of reforms were passed in that period of time that's a lot of change for people to go through in a very short time and whenever you have that there's going to be people who want to slam on the brakes and say hold on let us catch our breath maybe we're moving too fast with this maybe we need to think this through a little bit more some people will say you know what I don't like the direction the country is going I'm afraid it's heading toward a dictatorship this is getting to control and some people will do something that is unique in America America is a country that traditionally is used to having people come to it immigrants right we tend to look at closing our borders to keep the flow of immigrants trying to get in to slow down or even stop that tends to be America's position however during this period of time you see something happen it is very rare in American history what is expatriation leaving basically yeah it's people saying you know what I don't want to be an American anymore I'm going to move somewhere else I'm going to leave here and go there America is used to being the place that receives not the place that a lot of people choose to bail especially people who have a public voice that's what's interesting about this people who write are among the people who are leaving and that means that they can write about why they're leaving that increases the dissolution because that's convincing other people are going I understand now some of the people I'm talking about how about Gertrude Stein one of the biggest voices in the rise of the feminist movement in the early 20th century she decided to leave America and go live in Paris and to the day she died she says I will always be in America that's where I live so she never quite gave up the idea of being an American but she didn't want to live there anymore she wanted to be in Paris where things were a little less obsessive about the control similarly Ernest Hemingway Ernest Hemingway was one of those people in World War one who was really screwed up the war met him up bad and what did he do he's crawled into a bottle and was on that endless search for intimacy like a lot of the veterans were and he has heavily been criticized by people for years about being an alcoholic and a philanderer so people are still passing judgment on him without understanding exactly why he wrote a book called The Sun Also Rises it's one of his biggest novels and it is almost autobiographical he doesn't use his own name but it's more or less based on his life and his experience somebody who is disillusion Somebody went home and found it wasn't home anymore and so he came back to Europe as the next Patriot he went to live down in Spain he got into bullfight that became his big passion he was a bullfighting official and otherwise he drank and he fornicated for the rest of his life it was a novel of most of the veterans it told people why the veterans were acting the way they were acting that's why it was so significant another person who actually that's got Fitzgerald Great Gatsby that author yeah Scott Fitzgerald said you know what I'm leaving I don't like it here anymore I'm going to go live over in Europe too and so he will expatriate eventually but what makes him even more interesting he is from the upper class the Fitzgerald's were a family of high social status they were the elites he went to Princeton at a time when Ordinary People don't go to Princeton the elite in the upper middle class can go to Princeton but if you're below that you're not going to get in it's not like today where anybody who makes the grades can get it back then you had to come from a certain social standing and he had it that's what made his writing all the more shocking so another thing people were worried about after the war that led them to have some backlash against the reforms is the reforms became more and more associated with socialist and in 1919 something big happens in America during the war businesses realized it would be unpatriotic or excuse me not businesses workers I mean rephrase that workers realize it would be unpatriotic to strike if they were to hold a strike during the war they could be labeled as treasonous and only one major strike happened during the war and boy were they hammered for they never really recovered from that after the war most of them said you know what we've got grievances we want to strike everybody knows it but we have to wait until the end of the war we can't do it now so everybody is coming up with this we've got to strike but we can't wait and it builds up and builds up and more and more wanted right but they're withholding until the end of the war so basically what we've got is a red light and all the cars that normally flow along the road a little bit here a little bit there they're all jamming up and as soon as the light turns green into the war all right time to strike and that scares people when you suddenly see more than 2,600 strikes Nationwide in one year what are you afraid of what's that yeah a revolution and this is all the more scary because this is 1919 just two years earlier there were not one but two Revolution in Russia the first was a socialist Revolution the second was a Communist Revolution and in that one they took the royal family out lined them all up against the wall and executed every last one of them the romanovs were wiped out the royal family from Russia was executed so that they could not be brought back to the throne people in America remember that and they're seeing all of the union strikes and instead of saying well this is understandable because of this this and this they're saying wow this this same thing is about to happen here if we don't step in and stop it and so America gets it's very first Redskin there have been two major red scares in America this is the first one the Red Scare was the fear that America was succumbing to bolshevism the Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin are the ones who ultimately had the second revolution that established what was become the Soviet Union okay ideas what's the job to a government agent now this is pre FBI there wasn't a Federal Bureau of Investigation if there had been at this point it would have gone to them instead it was simply a federal agent who they referred to typically as Gmail government men his name was Palmer and he was given the task of eradicating Communism and removing that threat from America and so he and other agents went after the Communist infestation now where they sought mostly was from Eastern Europeans Eastern Europeans were most of the people involved with the Communist Party although not exclusively needs to be said that they weren't alone but the people that he targeted typically were Eastern European and from a period from 1919 to 1921 he started rounding them all up businesses were happy to help him when they pointed fingers at union leaders the people that they did not like as a way to suppress the unions they say oh you should look at them you should look at them and Palmer goes and says you know you're right there's a there's a communist of I've ever seen one and they grab them and put them in Holden and in 1921 he loads all the people he rounded up over 4,000 of them put them on a ship sales that ship to the Soviet Union he then dumped them off and says congratulations you all wanted to be communist you are now in a communist country bye and leave this became known as the Palmer race okay the Red Scare also turned on a lot of progressive reformers but most notably was Jane Adams was not a socialist she was just somebody who wanted to bring good change for her country as she saw and felt it needed it she wanted to bring religious change she wanted to bring assistance to people and helping them see America in a good way rather than a bad way so Jane Adams again she was the woman who started the settlement house movement she was involved in a lot of different Progressive movements and when they started questioning her it became clear that people were trying to associate Progressive changes that had been made with Communism businesses were especially hoping that people would say yeah you know what we should undo some of that stuff roll it back a bit so part of this is a pushback against the changes that happened too quick but people are genuinely afraid of socialism this also takes on a religious aspect does anybody in here red Karl Marx anyone none of you if you get out of this University without cracking the Communist Manifesto and at least scanning it period the basis for Lennon's ideas talked about religion in a specific way he called it the opiate of the masses opiate of the masses what is an opiate is what a drug yes what's it used for okay can be used for Sedation what else can it be used for there's opiates that are regularly prescribed to people today Norco Percocet pain they mask pain do they get rid of the cause no they say this is what they should do but nobody does that okay even back then when the morals were a little bit more tight than they are today girls are expected to remain Chase yeah right marriage is hard it's not the dream that ends everything it's a daily struggle you have to fight to work out it is not a romantic thing at least not entirely remove anything can be but the point here is they look at the world through Rose Colored Glasses the romantic era is coming to a screeching Hall we are entering a new era of History the realest period and whether they realize I realize it or not what's going on with the generation gap is happening internationally and on a much larger scale not just between one generation and the next but between the shift from seeing things how you want them to be and how you'd like to believe them to be to how they really are and the war is what wakes people up hey War isn't glorious it isn't heroic it isn't celebrated it's gory and it's deadly and it ruins people's entire family destroys entire community this wasn't heroic this wasn't glorious this was 5 years of a meat grinder that killed 10 million people and wounded 15 million more that is what people are looking face to face with and that more than anything is pulling people up with their assumptions in maybe we ought to look at the realities of things a bit more question what we assume and start looking at what is and the younger generation are on the front edge of this that's why they start separate the older generation is still following that romantic mindset the younger generation is turning toward a real estate they're on the search for truth and they see their parents as liars and hypocrites worse than Liars they tell the lies and they believe that the lies are true even though lots of examples can be pointed at that say they're not okay adults are shocked when the morality starts changing on such a rapid and wide scale what area you see this is what the dress code in 1920 the average hemline for women's dresses and skirts was 9 inches above the ground they're showing plenty of ankle by this point but they're still going well okay that's not so bad by 1921 the hemline was up to 12 inches off the ground on it it froze in a year now you're just below the knee and the older General pornographic ally what's more other styles are becoming popular the nice conservative neckline 3 inches starts to drop it here and then here and they're showing up and people are going that's a lot of skin they are concerned the fabric starts becoming more and more filmy and translucent to where you can almost see the skin color coming through the dress this is frightening the older generation I can't believe this is going high heels on meanwhile the women who are wearing these Styles also start doing other things they start wearing\u00a0 high heels or something that we're not common before this the Assam every now and then but not only do they give you more Heights but what else do you wear heels ladies yeah I see all the looks on your phone makes a little bit but looks when other men out there suddenly noticed \" wow\" oh yeah now before this who used cosmetics anyone who typically used cosmetics and so when these teenage girls start coming home with makeup on their face wearing high heels and these dresses that the parents think are rather inappropriate what's the reaction the older generation is genuinely scared of what's Happening smoking and drinking for women at least in public was absolutely frowned up and yet here during prohibition alcohol is supposed to be illegal and yet more and more people are getting drunk publicly than have in a long time why because it's fun to break the rules and the kids are rebelling they're rebelling against their parents they're rebelling against Society they're a billing against the restrictions on morality they're rebelling against a lot of stuff different names you probably heard it as the Roaring Twenties but it's also referred to as the Jazz Age music is changing who plays jazz who were those Jazz musicians who were so famous African Americans and the best jazz clubs we're black jazz clubs and a lot of the young white kids who wanted to go to the best jazz club for drinking and smoking and dancing because they love the music we're going to places like Harlem and their parents whether they admitted or not are very much in that racially biased mindset of that is that culture and ours is this culture and they really shouldn't be mixed so there is still this sense of white supremacy and separation so this miscegenation that's going on this intermixing it may not be anything more than just going and dancing to the music that they see this as a bad influence so it has a racial component to it but the dances they consider inappropriate the old dance slow methodical Ballroom dances but these dances are fast Charleston all over the place the foxtrot where if you want to dance the foxtrot properly the man and the woman who are dancing it they got to be smacked together because if you don't you won't be able to feel what the other person is doing and both of you are going to fall on your face so it forces people to be right up against each other which of course is part of the fun right is just uncorking over all of these changes so nice girls are now openly smoking in public all over the place and they are drinking illegally also keep in mind that one thing that made the Roaring Twenties roaring were some of the advantages that came with new technologies for example before you had lamps oil lamps when the sun went down you lit with lamps and candles and things like that now some of the homes especially if people who are a little more affluent have electricity this allowed you to dictate what you do any time of the day because hey middle of the night no big deal turn the lights on this allows them to have all my parties carbs another very important one cars are not always just a method of transportation sometimes they're the destination you know what I'm talking about cars are mobile privacy and so they can be used to get people to those late night parties or they could be used for two people to watch some of them okay so most parents don't really have a clue of what's going on until F Scott Fitzgerald tells them his very first novel was this side of paradise and keep in mind people know who Fitzgerald is they know his family his family is well known it'd be like saying Rockefeller you know who the Rockefellers are you may never have met him but you know who they are well they were a famous family they were high steps so when F Scott Fitzgerald puts out this book and they start reading it they're scandalized by what he's writing he's talking about how young people are getting together in big parties to turn into petting parts basically it's not quite orgy okay I'm not talking about that but figure a lot of people are getting the first and second base maybe not there asking for it or look it up online Google it don't embarrass yourself okay so something else that's changed I want to go back to the dress code a little bit there's something else very significant that's changing back in this period of time women in America especially war of particular article of clothing religious and most of you would cringe if you had to do it today it's called a corset you know what of course it is some of them men are going like this others are going the women all know do you like them brace that goes around your midsection and pulls in your stomach and your your midsection into a really tight form and the whole idea here is to really give you that nice hourglass figure and have your clothes hang really well so that everything looks like it's supposed and the problem with the corset is it's not exactly the healthiest thing to wear especially the way they were you ever seen those old movies where a woman Fates and a man carries her off to a couch and Ten's door and gives her air and maybe some water that actually happened a lot reason corset they can't breathe a flight of stairs that's enough to make them gasping for air that's tough and so if you really want to put a corset on right it's actually a three-person job three people to put on one corset one person holds it in place another person is pulling the two sides together as tightly as they go and a third person is very quickly lacing it up it can loosen up and the Lady Gaga breathe when the men come home from war they're used to being around French women and in France the course it was not very common and so when they come home they start having social engagements dances were very common and they're dancing with women and going what are you wearing is this armor what do you got a chastity belt might have to get a blow torch to get you out of this corset corset I don't like it when I dance with a woman I want to feel a woman no I don't like your corset gone so that's got Fitzgerald this is just sensationalist he's meant to try to create Scandal where there really isn't one check it out they're doubtful that it's real but no we really and what scares them is that he is absolutely 100% right on the money this is going on not just occasionally all over the place and the parents say okay we got to do something about this and the religious group are saying we definitely have to do something about this we have to save the morality of our country lots of different ways one way they're doing it also is talking about sex publicly now there's still a bit of a taboo about talking about sex publicly isn't there you go down to Starbucks and somebody's talking about a wild crazy night they in there significant other just had and they're doing it in very loud volume where everybody can hear it it kind of makes everybody a little uncomfortable doesn't it you don't really want to hear about somebody else talking about their sex yeah so this is something that is still kind of there but back then it was really tough you just don't talk about sex that's however young people got around this it was considered modern to talk about progress and science knowledge scholarship and one of the leading scientists at this point in time was generating a lot of interest is an Austrian psychologist his name study of analyzing dreams and he was the founder of psychoanalysis which is still used today to get into somebody's psyche and figure out what motivates him and you know what he found sex is the big motivator for most people in most situations that the underlying impulse is this need to procreate as a species he says this is part of our makeup we need Next Generation to come along and the way Humanity survives is through sex and so we are driven to it and so it's the motivation for a lot of our Behavior this was controversial but it makes a certain amount of sense and so the kids when they go out talking about sex in public when people finally settle down and after F Scott Fitzgerald Clues them in they're looking at the group of young women who are wearing the scanty clothing and dancing to Jazz drinking and smoking in public what do we call women who did all that what is it no no sex for it they're just out there having a good time drinking smoking dancing dressing and very what's that well you can describe they were called flappers because they get the name from the steps of the Charleston which was said to Jazz it was a very fast-paced dance where they kind of kick and flap their legs and arms and stuff and so people say oh well look at them they're flappers so there's a backlash against all of this the religious groups especially Protestant but not exclusively there are some Catholics and Jews who are also reacting to this start putting out speeches about how there's so much overabundant nudity in the world the indecent dance style and they point to the offensive dressing styles of the young ladies they push legislatures in their own areas to start doing something about this you've got to stop this pass some laws your regulate stuff keep in mind they've learned over the past 20 years and more this is how you deal with things the religious community motivated by the social gospel movement brought about social change through legislation you got to do that again do something about this religiously are thinking yeah what exactly can we do about this but they do try or at least they put some proposals out there they know those proposals will not be approved they're counting on keep that in mind in Utah 1921 there was a law proposed in the Utah State Legislature that would provide for any hemline that was more than three inches above the ground any woman who had a hemline higher than that would face fines and potential imprisonment for violating the law did not pass similarly in Virginia Allah was considered proposed where it says if any more than three inches not approved Ohio proposed to law that would prevent the sale of and this is a direct quote garment that which unduly displays or accentuates the lines of a female's figure first how do you judge that second what do you expect her to do wear a burlap sack for the rest of her life if clothing is going to fit their curves are going to come out somehow or another so what is duly or undoing can't really make it enforceable of course the law doesn't pass why did they propose him did they think the laws were passed no they're counting on them not but by putting that proposal out there whenever anybody says how come you're not doing something about it they can say I propose this restriction look at it I proposed it but they voted against it I can't be held for what they vote for but I put it out there I like that yes you're right you are doing what you can and you can't control what the other legislators it's their problem and that's kind of how people approach this whole thing they know this would be a real mess if it ever became law they're not going to go down that pound meanwhile the more controlling their parents try to get the more the younger generation Rebels it's like taking a handful of sand when you're out of the beach if you keep your hand nice and open the sandal stay there you can hold it like that for as long as you want Sam's going to more or less stay there but as soon as you try to squeeze it what happens to the sand from that control so younger generation starts rebelling a lot more they start invading their parents we're good kids were not really evading their parents their parents think they are just to get away from them for a couple hours and when they do do that and they catch him they assume the worst oh who have you been sleeping with you dirty minded hit I haven't been sleeping with anyone you automatically jump to the worst possible conclusion don't you tell that your mind is one in the gutter not mine and that becomes a weapon to use against their parents their parents of course get very Stern about that and this is just driving the generation further and further apart religious leaders of the time actually say you know why don't we take a step back and realize that every generation modifies the generations before it in their moral idea which is true you're going to see that with your own kids when you start having them if you start having them their generation will see things a little differently than your generation just as your generation sees things a little differently than my generation does on the hole and similarly mine to my parents okay so every generation modifies the moral code they say this is actually refreshingly honest look at them they are not hiding anything it's all out in the open about it they're being very open about it so don't worry about this this will blow over it's just a face they were wrong the traditionalist understanding the older Generations understanding of what is happening that world war one was to blame the war had awoken the Youth of the Nation to its own mortality is one of the first things you think of am I going to be alive at the end of the day does that go through your minds Maybe okay but most people they're not thinking wow today is today I can be dead especially when you're in your teens in 20s that's not high on the list of things but for the soldiers over in World War one that's very much the case I wonder if today's the day that I turn into that Carnage out there I wonder if my guts are going to be the guts hanging on that barbed wire this time 3 Doors Down for me and I get to see him rotting out there in no man's life so the older generation thinks that they've been awoken to the realities of death too early and this is leading to pleasure seeking behavior in other words in the old Roman adage eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die of this generation hey we could die tomorrow we could die The Day After Tomorrow we don't know we don't know how much time we've got left so we need to live life to the fullest let's enjoy it and so they're living like there is no tomorrow and that's how the older generation sees with the younger generation is done also politically President Wilson was talking about during this fight during World War I over the colonies of the Ottoman Empire that had fallen apart well this is largely part of why World War I was five Austria and Russia were both trying to take control of Southeastern Europe the part of the Ottoman Empire that both of them wanted a pizza okay and as a result of this he said rather than just keeping them colonies and switching ownership why don't we let them decide for themselves their future why don't we let them be countries on their own we give them self-determination and self-determination became a political buzzsprings during this period of time and the parents are afraid that the kids have heard self-determination and changed it into self gratification they've learned the wrong lesson from what was being said the youth understanding of what's happened their parents live in a dream world where they lie to themselves and then they believe it they are romanticizing everything without seeing things how they really are they talk about the evils of alcohol but they've got a bottle hidden in the back of the cupboard they talk about how women shouldn't be smoking but as soon as mom thinks there's nobody around first thing she does is the light up and all of a sudden the young people see them for the Hypocrites they really are and are they right are they hypocrites actually yeah they kind of are it's not so much that morality has really shifted all that much it's more that you can see it as long as it was behind closed doors nobody really said anything about it but as soon as it becomes public it becomes a problem they're just lying to themselves they're hypocrites what's more they see that the older generation constantly is trying to put on errors to convince people that they're better than they actually are they accept the speech pattern that emphasizes an exaggerated gentility in other words you ever heard somebody talking in a very what are you just talk straight say what you mean quit putting all this flowery talk in it you're making an ass of yourself that's essentially what they're saying they want to strip the language of it's falsity they want to strip the lies away from what the parents say things should be but they know as kids they're seeing the reality of it they said they're living in this romanticized world and we see the reality the kids are on a search for truth they seek truth are you going to go to a hypocrite if you're looking for truth no you're going to look for it elsewhere and that's essentially what the kids are doing so what's truly disturbing to the older generation is not that the generation up and coming is modifying the world code they understand completely checking it there is no moral code they replaced the image of the noble woman as the gate keeper reality in this very pure figure with someone else this new woman is Guinea drunken cigarette smoking alcohol drinking that's the new one they said we've got it inside and the religious community is really the driving force behind the backlash against this backlash notice the potential one just keep swinging back and forth progressivism reaction reaction to the reaction and the train starts out fairly small on the tracks and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger as it gets closer to the camera and about the time that it's filling up the entire camera people go start running from the room from that point they were hooked they love movies we still do and the movies during this period of time we're significantly more sexually graphic than the movies that will come out from the 30s to the early 60s the twenties actually got a little bit loose when it came to the moral standards they were a bit more sexually explicit they didn't actually show sex I mean we have that quite a bit in our movies today but don't judge them by the same standards by their standards it would be like going and seeing p*** flick in the movie theaters by the older Generations mindset oh yeah acquainted with new stars Rising on the Silver Screen it became what are known today as Rudolph Valentino play that last name Valentino what would you say his ethnicity would be Italian maybe Hispanic of some kind Latin just throw it in the Latin category okay Rudolph Valentino it's playing on this whole Latin lover Valentino was not his real name and he wasn't Italian but he played that so that he could be one of those romantic sex symbols why because white Anglo-Saxon Protestants can't be sections or Eastern European lovers but wide angle section Western European stock that was unacceptable so there's still a rules on what you can put on the screen but as long as the person was portrayed as somebody other than white Anglo sex and Protestant you're good this game rides to a new class of women in screen Vamps and she was very famous for her portrayal of Cleopatra at one point and if you actually Google Cleopatra eat a Barra it'll pop up a picture that is very famous of her rather scantily clothed laying lots of Skin showing heavy makeup dark hair and The Vamps were seen as dangerous women they were always women with the dark side but you could go with sexuality so the big name for the bombshell period where you see these women sex symbols emerge Greta Garbo Garbo was really the first big bombshell of the cinema world but Vamps were part of that explicit sexuality the problem here is first young people are starting to go so that's how you do it they're treating the movies as if they're instructional they're looking at them as instructions and the other big problem for people was the sex scandals in Hollywood that were becoming public we're giving Hollywood a bad name it was one thing for the movies to be criticized it was a very different one for the actual real life actors doing things that were drawing negative attention to the industry so much so that Hollywood will actually do something the business in America and very rarely has ever done self-regular they voluntarily get together and say we need to regulate this ourselves the government didn't step in and say you need to deal with this they did it themselves they said maybe we are getting a little too overboard on this we need to scale it back from that point on by the late 20s early 30s you see a big change they still allude to sex but you won't see the graphic nature of it you won't see hugely scantily clad you won't see people embracing and and going crazy and clearly about ready to get it on close the door and it fades to Black you know what happens in there you don't have to see it and that's how Hollywood will treat it from that point on and by the time we get to the fifties you have Ricky and Lucy I Love Lucy they sleep in separate beds anybody believe that one twin beds in the bedroom yeah how does little Ricky come along if they're so progressivism had died but the core of the progressivism was always the Social Gospel movie and that was still alive and well now the social gospel movement is trying to take on a lot of these things putting speeches out there about how the styles are going to change they try to put out propaganda to convince the kids that the styles are going to get longer and longer and longer kids don't buy it there's a number of other things that rise that they consider a crisis of protestantism a religious crisis the erosion of moral standards was part of it but more than that the rise of civil marriages instead of church marriages instead of people getting married in the church a lot more people are going down to the justice of the peace getting a judge to Marion so City Hall becomes a much more commonplace for people to get married the rise of domestic Catholics 1/3 of America is Catholic by the end of the 20s this is one of the things that's driving the Ku Klux Klan they're able to recruit a lot of people because people are really scared about the number of Catholics that are in America 1/3 be ignoring of the prohibition laws drives the Protestants nuts those Social Gospel reformers who finally accomplished what they wanted they banned alcohol not only did not shut it down alcohol consumption is getting higher and higher every year also disturbing to religious communities is a new growing approach to things in Academia it's called cultural relativity religions are not actually divinely inspired they are social constructs that people create so what your practicing as a religion isn't something that God inspired you to it's something that people use in order to create a moral guideline for their community social control also you see the rise of new areas of academics Fields up to this point when people looked at religions other than Christianity there was judgment implied they are looking at a religion say Buddhism for example well clearly Buddhists are not the proper thing and they went in with that mindset automatically now they're saying let's take away the judgment and let's just look at what they believe and what they practice and how it is applied in their lives and they do that with other religions around the world rather than implying that one is right and the rest are wrong study religion that was disturbing to people in this period of time the question that their way might not be right wow they would not accept that science is what a lot of them will point to send this whole idea of progress and modernity they're pointing to science and you know who the scientist who is really responsible for all of this immorality all the people that we're dealing with today Darwin if this whole idea that God didn't create people they got created from the Apes they evolved into people they weren't created as people we were monkeys once oh yeah I buy that and they start pointing the finger at Darwin and they will start pushing legislators to pass regulations throughout the 20s and there's more reason than this than just people turning against religion although Veterans as a whole typically look at religion as I only go to church for two things in life marrying and very the rest of it they can have that's how veterans are starting to react to the church others</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/History%201460-04/Week%209/1460%20Mar%2022/","title":"1460 Mar

Movement and the rise of people who are religious feeling like their way of life is being put under a cat if they have to protect it people are starting to ignore prohibition and doing things that are really getting to people who are hard workers to really put massive amounts of effort into getting these things legislated and that just makes them grind their teeth former progressives Social Gospel members are ultimately behind a move that we would consider Christian fundamentalism which is again taking your religious and moral views and legislating them okay getting that past is legislation this could be a good example of that and it was a law that was passed in the state of Tennessee called The Butler Act of 1925 the butler act specifically forbade Public Schools from teaching Charles Darwin's theory of evolution as a matter of fact the exact wording is that any curriculum or anything that tended to contradict the biblical view of the world was illegal to teach in school now what does that sound like to you maybe a violation of the First Amendment yeah it is in a big way however here's something to keep in mind the Supreme Court is made up a majority of Southerners five out of the nine justices are southern and all of the nine justices are religious so keep that in mind but there was more at play than just trying to legislate morality which they were trying to do the butler act also contradicted another Act that was already on the books there was a law in the state of Tennessee that required all public school teachers to teach the approved District curriculums that were assigned so whether or not they wanted to teach a particular book they had to teach that book they were required by law to do so the approved curriculum included a textbook for science that had an entire chapter on Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution one law is requiring them to teach it the other laws forbidding them from teaching them so they're between a rock and a hard place this is a real problem for them now there's a science teacher in the town of Dayton Tennessee who really is disturbed by this it's not that he isn't religious he is and it's not that he doesn't hold to these larger ideals that everybody else does and is afraid that religion is under attack but at the same time he sees that the suppression of science is not a good direction for people in a free country to go about he does not like this direction the science teacher is like well a lot of science teachers that you probably had along the years right he's maybe not the most personal guy he's not unpleasant he's happy he tries to get his students involved to get the fired up about it but at the same time none of the other teachers are really asking hey what are you doing this weekend you want to hook up and and go play some ball or something you know nobody's like really engaging and he's afraid that if he actually were to try to teach this that he could play what's more the American civil liberties Union has gotten into this the ACLU the aclu's primary job as they have set out is to defend the First Amendment so anytime the first amendment is infringed upon by any law that they see needs to be addressed they go after it they try to get it into the courts so that it can be argued so that it can go up in front of judicial challenge and the ACLU is being pushed also by another very very powerful influential group of people in America publishers newspaper people when you're talking about people in newspapers I mean by Today's Energy though well newspapers you know what's what's the big deal I mean who who really control they're actually owned by someone you guys ever hear of Hearst Castle Hearst Castle is this giant massive estate that was created by newspaper Mogul William Randolph Hearst it's up on the coast of California and it's a few months it's what maybe three or four hours from here something like that up in San Simeon if you ever get the chance to go through it by the way take the tour oh my God but he didn't make that out of chump change that guy was one of the richest people in America as are a lot of the Publishers and so this is a very very powerful group of people who are also really concerned anytime somebody is violating the First Amendment because if they're willing to violate freedom of religion or the exercise thereof they might also start in on the Press limiting what they can publish and they hold freedom of the press very seriously they don't want people messing with that so any challenge for the First Amendment they go after they are pushing the ACLU to do something about this and the ACLU takes up the challenge they say we will take care of everything if there's a science teacher out there who is willing to deliberately break the butler Act break the law so that it can be heard in courts and the ACLU will pay any fines they will pay for all of your legal fees you don't have to pay anything out of pocket and if you lose any work time they will compensate you for any lost wages so they're willing to help you out if you're willing to help them out this science teacher is saying boy I really wish I could do this but I'm afraid I'll get fired if I do this a man named John Scopes is the high school football coach and just as it is today football in the south is a religion of its own and of all the people who are very important to people in the south a winning football coach is a very popular guy and John Scopes teams win he's a good coach but he also happens to be the go to substitute teacher anytime somebody in Dayton calls in sick and so the science teacher approaches him and says hey John I got a problem here I'm really concerned about this and I'd love to break the butler act but I'm afraid they're going to fire me if I do that and I'm required to teach it by law also because it's the curriculum I don't know what to do if I were to call in sick and you were to do this they would be willing to back you up with any kind of legal defense fees or anything else but I know they won't fire you you're the football coach and everybody loves you and he was he was one of those sender of the party gregarious kind of people you know he's he's so many of the people like very applicable on the designated day he calls up sick okay everyone today I want you to open to page blah blah blah we're going to talk about Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution and at that point if you were one of the students in that classroom your eyes probably just went wait a minute the entire class talking about the theory of evolution Journey Down to the Galapagos Islands and all of that he taught the whole the whole chapter afterwards he gets arrested for violating the butler act which was planned everybody knew it was coming and when it comes down to it and the kids are going well shoot we like Mr skills we don't want to say anything bad about it and he says kids if any of you were called up and asked about things I want you to be 100% open and honest about everything don't try to cover for me okay if they ask whether I taught Charles Darwin's theory of evolution you say yes I spent the whole class talking about it be perfectly honest and over don't feel like you're doing something again he was arrested very shortly whether it was that day or the following morning or something like that he may have spent the night in jail I don't remember but he comes up before a judge in his bail is set at $500 now back then 500 bucks is a lot of money and yet as soon as it was done it was paid by the time he was out of the courtroom that quick it was paid by the owner of the Baltimore Sun newspaper the publisher of the newspaper himself paid it now to give you an idea of the significance of that paper where's Baltimore Maryland does anybody know what Baltimore is close to it's about 45 minutes by car away from a particular place it's very important DC in other words Baltimore Sun newspaper is the paper that a lot of the people in DC wake up and read over their morning coffee this is a very influential newspaper and it also has one of the most influential columnist in the entire country writing for it HL Menken mankin is known as the sage of Baltimore the sage the wise person of Baltimore and he has a certain way of creating I don't know sort of feelings and images by his language that are very witty and very unique and he will do so here with this case too the ACLU is ready to go and they've already got a defense attorney lined up ready for John Scopes none other than Clarence Darrow Clarence Darrow is the best defense attorney in the entire country they are just bringing out the big guns they're bringing out the A-bomb okay this guy is as good as a cats they are leaving nothing to chance as a matter of fact the people in Dayton Tennessee are going we're now the focus of everybody and everybody's watching this and now we got the biggest defense lawyer coming in the prosecutor saying there's no way I can win against him I mean I'm not a bad attorney but that guy's Barrel we got to bring somebody in who can really go head-to-head with him we got to bring in a special prosecutor so they do they turn to former presidential candidate evangelist silver right you guys remember the free silver movement right gold standard trying to get silver back in William Jennings Bryan they turned to him now he hasn't been in a courtroom in over 30 years but he does still have his license to practice and they talked to him and say look not only are you a lawyer but you have the same values that we do when it comes to this and we're hoping that you will be the special prosecutor for this case so now you have a standoff between arguably the most famous evangelist in the country who is the prosecuting attorney and the most powerful influential and successful defense attorney in the country the journalists Across America are all poise ready to start writing they know that this trial is going to be sensational and it's going to sell a lot of papers too so the thing I should tell you about this case it was botched horribly start to finish top to bottom and side to side 100% screwed up and the reason it was screwed up is because of the judge the judge only allowed the prosecution to call witnesses it did not allow for witnesses to be called by the defense talk about a miscarriage of Justice if there ever was one as a matter of fact there was only one witness the judge allowed to be called by Clarence Darrow and that was when he called William Jennings Bryan himself to the stand he put Brian on the stand and then he drilled him for hours and William Jennings Brian could not answer directly to anything because he knew any answer that he gave of any real substance would tend to implicate his cause so he just spent the whole time he was on the stand deflect deflect deflect deflect deflect that's all he was doing the whole time deflecting the jury knew it was going on but at the same time they hadn't been allowed to hear any Witnesses for the defense so essentially there had been no real defense guilty he was guilty of violating the butler act they heard nothing counter to that no contrary idea to that so that's what they gave her and which point the judge said okay the finest said at $100 next case $100 fine before the ink was even dry they already have the appeal file with the state of Tennessee Supreme Court the state of Tennessee Supreme Court refused to hear the case on a point by Point basis they said we don't see anything wrong with what the judge did with what the prosecution did we don't think there was a miscarriage of Justice though they're clearly was everything looks fine to us except for one little thing they said procedurally the jury should have set the fine instead of the judge and therefore the $100 fine was set aside Scopes didn't have to pay the fine so basically now he's guilty of the law but he doesn't have to pay a penalty for it he's just been put through all of this the appeal is made to the Supreme Court of the United States the justices wouldn't hear the case and as soon as it came out that the justices won't hear the case all hell breaks loose okay as this trial is proceeding different journalists are writing about it along the way and HL Menken was the most visible of these it is he that dubbed the Scopes trial to be the Scopes Monkey Trial this is the monkey truck now why did they call it the Monkey Trial okay yeah it's it's a play on Darwin you know monkeys evolving to humans okay but making being who he is that wasn't the only reason he starts referring to William Jennings Brian throughout all of his comments as a buffoon and he uses it repeatedly you are hearing so the real Monkey Trial is not about Charles Darwin it's about the circus in this courtroom and the person who is really the unevolved monkey is who William Jennings Bryan basically it was him saying Brian is stuck in the past he has no ability to evolve with the times he is not modern he is not up to Modern progress and science he wants to hold to his own little view of the world and he's unwilling to even consider reality that's the implication Brian becomes the unevolved baboon he's the monkey others will pick up the name and pretty soon everybody's calling it The Monkey try or the Scopes Monkey Trial before long others are writing about how slanted the judge and Jerry were how they were unanimously hot for Genesis and then the number two publication in America jumped into the discussion the number two publication of the time was Time Magazine Time Magazine finally got into it as well and when they did Time Magazine ridiculed the trial from front to back as a crusade and a circus religious crusade in the circus it was a spectacle that they put on it was a show but it was also in pursuit of this religious cause to Ram it down everybody else's throat that was the position they took and then following all of this oh and by the way they referred to the people of Dayton Tennessee as being Brian's moron followers and yes they used the word moron and the equated them with the Pied Piper of Hamlin's story you guys have you ever heard of this how a town had a rat problem and the Pied Piper was paid to come in and get rid of the rats and he started playing on his flute and he let all the rats out to the cliff and they all jumped overboard because he was playing his his flute okay so essentially they're calling the people more or less idiot Lemmings we'll just walk off the edge of the cliff because Brian wants them too the people of Tennessee are now under direct attack there's already enough division between the country and I'll go into this minute but now they're really feeling injured and they're feeling like they've been backed into a corner everybody's attacking him and they're kind of going what's going on here and then Life Magazine gets into it Life Magazine is the number one publication in America Life Magazine does not go after the people of Dayton at least not aggressively like others instead it says well they're just traditionally minded and they don't keep up with the times it's not really their fault and we should actually feel sorry for them feeling sorry for someone sometimes is even worse than attacking them directly penny can be insulting but more than that they then go after William Jennings Bryan like magazine awards William Jennings Bryan the brass medal of fourth class does that sound like brass medical and here's a direct quote successfully demonstrated by the Alchemy of ignorance notice they're playing on the whole using a fake science to create a transmutation from one substance to another Alchemy is a long debunked field the Alchemy of ignorance that hot air may be transmuted into gold and they're also playing on the whole silver right thing the cross of gold speech that he gave and all that William Jennings Bryan died just a few days after this article team he did not live long after this what was this about what was the Scopes trial and all of the controversy about science versus religion that was certainly part of it that's been something that's been going on since the rise of really the Renaissance science versus religion religious versus secular Where's the Line they were definitely blurring in Tennessee is are we living in a place where separation of church and state exists well clearly it is in existing here where's that lines so the battle against religion versus secular but also is another key battle to keep in mind the divide in America over Urban versus rural now why is this significant at no time in American history was urban and rural more divided in America than in the 20s and 30s why think about the new technologies that are emerging in the cities by the 1920s electricity is now in suburbs around cities they have indoor plumbing where you have hot and cold water faucets you have flush toilets you have all of these modern conveniences and electric appliances your home is more modern you're living on The Cutting Edge of progress whereas the people on farms still go to bathroom in the Outhouse out back when they have a bath which they might have every once twice a month they have to haul the water in that they get themselves from either a pump or from the river and then put it in pots and heat it up over a fire and babe that way they don't like their house with electric lights they light it with oil lamps candles in other words technologically while they might only be 20 years behind the cities they might as well be a hundred and twenty years behind the cities they're still living with 1800s technology even 1700s technology they are not living in the present as far as people in the city are concerned they're stuck in the past there's a Time Warp that's happened some people are at the Forefront of it and some people got left behind and this difference is huge in America now is there a divide in America today Urban versus rural what do you think yes no kind of I see some people going yeah okay a little bit yeah there's a divide I'll tell you what you go spend a week in New York City go see the sites and then go to how about summer and Kansas and spend a week there and you'll see a big difference between the two there is a divide between urban and rural there is a divide between the culture of the city and the culture of small town America they are different there's a different field there's a different mindset there's a different approach to life so that divide does still exist but people in the country today have electricity they have indoor plumbing they have hot and cold running water they have flush toilets they're still modern they might be rural but they're modern back then they weren't that divide was an enormous Gap and it cannot be underestimated it was huge now keep in mind most of the areas that are really being affected by this which means it's in the south okay the South lost the Civil War and they are still gnawing over this 70 years later they're still complaining about the war of Northern aggression and how they want to get back the way things were still going over that over and over and you know what you give us some places in the South they still are still a lot of people would love to go back and undo a lot of the stuff around the Civil War they still call it the war of Northern aggression down her story so because this is in the South it becomes a North versus South battle all over again a lot of Southerners felt like it was almost like the Civil War had been launched again in the north was invading him all over again they just wanted to protect their way of life but they did it by violating the first amendment in the process and the courts refused to hold them accountable for northerners said this is a travesty of our system it is un-American because this miscarriage of Justice his leading to the wrong paths for our country the southerners are saying hey we see the way life is up north we see the way life is in the city city life is alienating to people and we'll stand up for our traditions we take care of our communities people live with their neighbors and their neighbors know them and they know their neighbors there's a community they're part of in the city you're a person who is an island in the middle of the ocean are they right absolutely you go live in some place like New York surrounded by 10 million people how many of them do you actually know your next door neighbor Maybe maybe not even then you have your own little circle of friends and that's about it so it is alienating they're right there are some things about cities that are isolating and alienating for people communities have a whole lot harder time building up in an urban environment than they do in a rural environment where everybody knows everybody else so yeah they're right one thing that really characterizes the southern reaction is throughout all of it it is permeating with nostalgia looking back to the good old days everything was better in the past in the south is always looking backwards do they still do that to an extent a lot of people do although a lot of people do look forward now but it took a long time for the South to come around to that and some people still haven't some people are still looking back and saying man we need to get back to the way things were going on this frustration wanting something better in the past but also you notice that the past always has seen through an ideal lens when people talk about the good old days they don't really talk about the bad things everything is through rose-colored glasses Romanticism yes it is a romantic view of the past and if you want to put a point on it during this period of time the cities have embraced the realism movement modernism progress that kind of thing whereas the countryside is still in that Romantic Period so that's that's a very viable observation yes it is Romance they have a romanticized ideal of their own Society but they don't always see the flaws in it many of their arguments actually are shared with the group of people after World War one who became very discontent with America this group of people by this point has gotten a label they are called The Lost Generation who after World War I looked around American said I hate this place I'm getting out of here and they went to live elsewhere they picked up and left they felt disillusion they felt like country was no longer the country they grew up in they felt like progress was not a good thing it was a bad thing they were being alienated isolated they didn't feel like they had a community and so a lot of the same arguments that the south is using during this time in reaction to all the abuse that taken shares a lot of the common criticisms of society that The Lost Generation are also pointing to and they're right there are things in the country that are screwed up they have a legitimate reason to be concerned about so the south is able to really get hooks into those saying hey you come live in our town for a while and see just how good things can be yeah we don't have some of the modern fancy things that you do we have people who care about each other to take care of each other we're there for one another in our communities what do you have and that's basically how they approach it the 1930s will make a big wake-up call for America why what happened in the 30s anyone yeah the depression good yes 1929 the stock market crashed and don't let me tell you that that is what started the great Great Depression it isn't the market has crashed worse than that one since then the 1987 crash was our worst nearly twice as bad as the 29 crash did you hear about a depression in 1987 no reason being there wasn't one the problem with the 1929 crash is it the banks had become involved because they were loaning money to people who were speculating in the stock market in other words people were gambling with borrowed money and when you gamble with borrowed money in a casino that can make you lose it all overnight if it goes to the wrong direction ouch means you can't pay back your bookie said hey I don't got it what happens when that happens across the board the banks go looking for their money back and the people can't repay their debts so the banks are failing that's why the failure of the banking system and when it took a tank when it started going down people began questioning the American way of life saying maybe the Communists were right maybe capitalism is due I mean things were good in the twenties but boy it's your turn around and it's not getting better one year leads to another and it's worse and it leads to another and it's worse by 1932 they bounce off the bottom they hit so low 25% national unemployment yikes that is vicious and the economy doesn't show signs of getting better sure Roosevelt will come out with the New Deal in 1933 and things will slightly give people more hope but the economy still is sluggish not recovering well here's one of those old adages whenever times or bad what happens religiously people find their way back to religion the 1930s are an interesting time because that does happen on a big scale lots of people say you know what I need to get back to my religious roots and they'll start turning to God for answers however a lot of people are going to go the other way and they're going to say the depression just proves what Karl Marx has been saying there is no God what else do you get with people getting back into religion you also get the rise of atheism yet people rejecting the whole concept of religion completely and a lot of people start becoming very interested in communism why the Great Depression was great not because it just affected America worse than it ever has it was great because it's spanned most of the globe America's problem took the rest of the world with it that's how influential our economy was at that point you really want to see how influential a nation's economy is what's that Nation have a complete meltdown in their economic system and see what happens to the rest of the world the rest of the world doesn't even notice your country isn't that important if it sinks the entire world economy you know something's wrong and that's ultimately what happened let it not be said that we didn't learn World War II we learned how to do propaganda for real we learned how to motivate people and so the war with Germany was turned into a religious Crusade Hitler and the German Nazis are the forces of evil they are the spawns of hell and it is our job as a good Godly country to go out and smite the forces of hell and Kill Them All for God America mom apple pie Uncle Sam do your part stay focused on the world for Germans now the message instead of portraying them as evil monsters from hell portrayed typically as rodents now if you have a rodent problem in your house what do you call an exterminator they focused on the Revenge edge with them people were angry with Japan because they bombed Pearl Harbor and they wanted payback and so they started characterizing the Japanese as little more than rodents that we need to go forth and exterminate so on one hand we are decrying the evil of Hitler and on the other we're getting bloodthirsty ourselves but both of them are done within the context of being people who are fighting God's work doing God's job here on the planet and so World War I become very religious to the point where being religious and being a patriot for the same thing you couldn't have one without the other during World War II people started going to church regularly even if you were one of those people who was slacking off not during World War II you start going to church every Sunday or if you're Jewish every Saturday you go all the time and there was a saying in World War II among soldiers there are no atheists in foxholes what does that mean no atheists who don't know what a box hole is when a soldier is on the battlefield and there's nothing to shelter them from anything they dig a hole in the ground that where they can get their head below ground level and the reason for that is because when artillery or grenades or anything that explodes comes over if you are below the level of that and it explodes the shards are going to go over your head the only way you die in an artillery barrage if you are in your Foxhole and it's made properly is if it lands on you in your home the lens in your hole you're screwed but anywhere else you have a good chance of surviving but the whole time those artillery shells are blowing up around you you are scared quite literally if you are not soiling Yourself by the end of it I would be very surprised it is a horrible experience and being in that situation what are you doing the whole time there is a God please give me through this that sort of God that's what you're doing that's what it means when they say there are no atheists not believing in God you're still going to be praying in the Foxhole it's kind of like what do you do when the planes going down and you know you're about to die do you hold on just go all the way down to the ground or same there are no atheists and because of this religion becomes patriotic and being a patriot means you are religious in other words separation of church and state just went completely out the window pursuing the American dream and I'm going to talk extensively about the American dream when we get to the consumerism section because it's all about consuming but part of being a good American is you go to church every week it became your political Duty as a good citizen to go to church and everything took on a religious mindset not just a political for example the Pledge of Allegiance had been around for a long time how many of you have learned the Pledge of Allegiance at some point in your life all of you okay one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all that was the original text after World War II they inserted two words under God all of a sudden this became a religious Duty you are affirming that you were in line with that religious aspect he still haven't changed that they still haven't put it back to the way it was but they don't require kids to say it every day anymore either from what I understand or do that they don't I thought they got rid of that you still learning some point but in 1949 49 was a big year for the world in the post war America's Duty was to God and having a good Godly country but it also met a capitalist country capitalism and God are associated with each other communism was what Godless remember the original Red Scare they started saying they're Godless Communists and emphasizing that well in 1949 something's going to happen to resurrect that again after the war America and the Soviet Union are already tensed against each other Stalin's trying to take over the eastern half of Europe and he's doing a good job and the United States is trying to stop it but the United States is rather belligerent and we are lighting up nuclear weapons like they are firecrackers in our own personal 4th of July show hey you like that one boom chicka Slovakia will you boom how do you like that how would you like that over Moscow that's kind of the message they're sending well in 49 with the test called Joe one named after Joseph Stalin the Soviet Union up in Siberia and people said wow they've got nuclear weapons and other people were saying and that nuclear detonation looks exactly like the bomb we dropped on Nagasaki how did they get the bomb only 4 years after we dropped it how did they get that technology they didn't have a Manhattan Project like we did he didn't spend over 2 billion dollars to develop it they certainly didn't commit all their scientists to doing how did they get that how do you think they got it they stole it yes it's fine nuclear spies and so in 1949 it leads to a spy hunt and lo and behold they finally well it wasn't really that hard in a safe little Eastern European couple named Julius and apple Rosenberg were taking material from two different scientists in the Manhattan Project and passing it on to the Soviet Union they were put on trial and ultimately and I think 51 or maybe 52 one of those two years they were executed Ethel Rosenberg were killed for this it was a reasonable offense to give the enemy well actually they weren't even the enemy but to give away military Secrets during a time of War that's a big number and so the discovery of these spies in 1949 1950 LED Congress to start hunting infestation in America to try to eradicate this is America's second big anti-communist Witch Hunt it's second Red Scare and this one was even bigger than the Palmer rates this one was being held publicly in Congress they started hosting hearings where they would bring people who have been accused of some kind of communist connection into answer questions in front of Congress who did they target did they go after the leaders of the Communist party did they go after big union leaders the way Palmer did who did they target anybody know who was brought up in front of those trials nobody's talked about it as you grew up yeah and who were those people who are they targeting they were targeting one particular group of people they were targeting people in the entertainment industry why America has just learned the real power of propaganda they're not trying to Kill the Messenger they're trying to kill the message and the message is clear we're not going to allow a communist message to run counter to our capitalist one so Hollywood is going to walk the capitalist line if you are accused even without proof it can destroy your career in a lot of people in Hollywood had their careers completely wrecked and they were communist other people it's interesting actually got through it and it turns out that they at least now I've got a really interesting document that I like to show every now and then it's a copy of somebody's voter registration card have you heard of the show I Love Lucy Lucille Ball I Love Lucy the crazy redhead in was Lucille Ball and Lucille Ball was accused of communist ties during this period of time she was brought up in front of the house on American Activities Committee now the interesting thing is when she was brought up they questioned her a little bit and then said oh well clearly they were an error she is not a communist Lucille Ball you're free to go and her career went on like crazy here's the rub I actually have a photocopy of her brother registration from 1930s and on the political party line in her own handwriting it says communist who so why did she get off or so many others have their careers destroyed turns out Jay Edgar Hoover who was the head of the FBI and arguably the most powerful man in the country he had dirt on everyone I mean if you're looking for The Godfather that was who he was the guy and turns out that his favorite show was I Love Lucy and he went to Senator McCarthy he says I don't really care how this goes I don't care what you do what you say but bottom line you sealed ball is not a communist repeat after me Lucille Ball is not a communist McCarthy goes I'll take care of it and she got off because Hoover wanted her to get off kind of an interesting look into our traditional system they actually have the butter registration card I mean you know come on in her own hand right now she was a communist during the Great Depression but a lot of people were communist during the Great Depression and afterwards massive explosion of religious activity because of the war and the aftermath being American religious being religious make you or being a good American the two were blurred separation of church and state gone being religious meant you are a good American it was your political duty to go to church and they broaden the definition of this up to this point America has been heavily focused on trying to show everybody that white Anglo-Saxon Protestant religion is the way to go but now after the Holocaust and Hitler killed three quarters of the Jews on the planet in 1945 a little too little and a little too late we finally opened our doors so that the Jews who were still at risk to get out before Hitler can kill him that's why today the United States is the largest Jewish population of any country in the world even more than Israel and because they're Jews we don't want to kick them when they're down they just went through the Holocaust that's a horrific thing whole family's were wiped out Generations ended and oh they're over it now yeah they're well over now but it's taking them over half century to recover too yes and no that's actually a little bit more involved I'll talk to you afterwards if you want to hear the whole story but yes there are some that are incredibly wealthy and there's others who are not most or not okay but a handful of them are incredibly low yes okay so people are saying well the Jews who are coming over they want to be good Americans too and they're grateful to the country and they want to be loyal to the country and well their religions different than ours so they say okay well the Jews were started responsible for getting Jesus crucified but at the same time Jesus was a Jew yeah maybe maybe we can cut him some slack there so being a good American means you go to church or you go to Temple they said well what about the capital okay they go to church too they can be good Americans fine so all of a sudden so long as you're going to church and your Jewish Protestant Catholic all of a sudden you can be those and be a good American the key is you were active at this point a new phrase did you Dale Christian tradition this is when that phrase came about where Americans who are the ideal prototypical Americans were good God fearing people and they were of the judeo Christian today and that kind of wants together all the denominations of Christianity Catholic or Protestant and Judaism and whatever branches they might have and there's a number of different sects of Judaism too so so long as you fit that General description hey great you're a loyal American good hard working you can go after the American dream go for it but that became part of what it meant to me in America because of this and what the Jews went through the Holocaust changed the way Americans look at religion and all of a sudden people start saying you know we've been hating Catholics for a long time but really they're not so bad you know they basically believe the same thing we do yeah they have different ways of practicing their church but you know they're belief system is still more or less what ours is they're not really bad people we should look for things that we have in common with Catholics and Jews a lot of social things where Catholics Protestants and Jews all more or less see things the same way we should start cooperating with each other what a concept and so for the first time in American history throughout the 40s and 50s you start seeing increasing cooperation and all of a sudden attitudes toward different religions start softening so long as they fit into that greater judeo-christian tradition definition to the point where by the end of the 1950s you have a presidential election in 1960 and the result of that election is the very first Irish Catholic became president Kennedy we finally elected somebody who wasn't a Protestant to be president of the United States that was a significant time religiously in America because by this point while still people did kind of look down their nose at Catholics Catholics are not being completely discriminated against and hammered the way they were before there are still people who take issue with different religious sex okay Protestants who don't really like Catholicism Catholics you don't really like the way Protestants do things but by and large most people are pretty accepting oh you're Christian where do you go why go to the Catholic Church down there and that's it so the animosities are dying down the 1960s however were a turbulent time for a lot of reasons there were protests there was the Civil Rights Movement there was the Vietnam War the women's movement I mean there's all kinds of things going on in the 60s where everybody is getting active the country in a lot of ways is tearing itself apart and it's also being introduced to a lot of new religious ideas that they hadn't really looked at much before now it's not saying the religion is new but just those ideas for Americans to have to come have to deal with that's what's new they haven't really encountered them in any big amount at least most of them have because of what was happening in Vietnam the North and South Vietnamese War and the South because they allied with America we're getting really heavily targeted by the North Vietnamese the Vietnam and the Viet Kong was targeting people in the South and going after him and killing and so people from the South start wanting to get out and they're turning to the US and hey we got to have a place to go they're trying to kill us and so the United States passes the Immigration Act of 1965 a whole bunch of anti-asian immigration legislation was still on the books this act starts getting rid of it all and it basically opens up the door so that we can start letting the Vietnamese in who want to flee that well when Vietnamese and other people from Asia it doesn't just open up for the Vietnam people people from Cambodia people from Laos people from Thailand people from India they start coming in in larger and larger number and when they come they bring their religions with them so suddenly we are getting a whole bunch of people from Asia who are Muslims Hindus Buddhists and several other different religions but those are the three big ones that everybody has to start coming to grips with everybody's looking around them wow worshiping like a hundred and some odd gods or something yikes you seen him they got like little Idols for them that's not right and you start getting this Western versus Eastern criticism of religion the era of protest however LED for the younger generation to start reevaluating their ideas about religion not actually most people become whatever their parents were and now in America you see the Youth of America rebelling like crazy and when they do they start saying well I'm not sure if I like what my parents are talking about maybe I should go evaluate myself and they'll start looking into other things now what this usually amounts to is switching to nomination it's not that somebody who's Christian necessarily becomes non-Christian they they go into some other religion but most of the shifting goes well I'm Baptist I want to go Methodist if I'm Methodist maybe I want to go Catholic if I'm Catholic maybe I choose to go Protestant maybe I like Baptist maybe I like Presbyterians and people will start shifting denominations in a way they never have before that was very unusual but you also get Jews converting to Christianity Christians converting to from protestantism to Catholicism or back and forth even Christians converting to Judaism becomes common but something else that starts creeping in they get interested in the Eastern Religion Center coming in and then something happens to kick that into high gear The Beatles The Fab Four yes Paul John Ringo and George The Fab Four The Beatles they got involved in looking at the Eastern religions they were John Lennon especially was a big critic of America's participation in Vietnam he was a big anti-war guy but he also became fascinated with Eastern religions and he wanted to get in there and study and the others kind of went along too after they started talking to the first Guru a guru by the way if you've ever heard that term is a religious person who can serve as a mentor or a guide somebody to instruct you into how to properly practice a religion that's what a guru is and they studied with a couple different gurus the first Guru kind of introduced them to him and George excuse me Ringo Ringo Starr said well guys it's not really for me I'm going home you know I'm fascinated by all this it's not my cup of tea but I love it it's beautiful and he goes home John really wants to learn everything he can about it John Lennon really gets into it but in the end he also says okay I love it I love what you guys do with it it's beautiful George converts to him and to the day he died George Harrison will be a Hindu for the rest of his life so the outcome of this though if the Beatles do it it must be cool and they set a pad where young people get interested in the Eastern religions plus who's another way you can Rebel with this the last thing mom and dad good Preston Christians want to hear is my child converted to Hinduism oh my gosh my kid came home a Buddhist can you believe that starts to happen and the Beatles have a lot of reason for that wow we are out of time okay enjoy your spring break again did everybody get the message through canvas and everything that automatically went to you okay the test is pushed back a week I've already altered all of the dates for it so it should come up correctly in canvas and I also posted in the extra credit assignment a link to the video so if you open up the assignment you'll see the link right there at the top you can click that and watch the video streaming online okay so all of that is there have a wonderful vacation I will see you the following Monday yeah for the</p>"},{"location":"2023%20Winter/Math%202720-05/2720%20Feb%206/","title":"2720
